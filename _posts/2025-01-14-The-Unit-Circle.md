# The Unit Circle: APPC 3.2
APPC, or Advanced Placement Precalculus, teaches Trigonometry for unit 3. Here's a summary of 3.2 for my practice and your learning journey. :) 
* θ = angle, theta is a greek letter used to represent such. 

## What is the Unit Circle?
A Unit Circle is a circle with a radius of 1. This makes all of the calculations relating to the Unit Circle simpler. 

## SOH CAH TOA? Who's that?
In Geometry, we learned sine, cosine, and tangent with SOH CAH TOA. Sine is opposite/hypotenuse, cosine is adjacent/hypotenuse, and tangent is opposite/adjacent. However, during the lecture, we no longer use SOH CAH TOA! <br><br>
Instead, we use Sinθ = displacement of y/radius, Cosθ = displacement of x/radius, tanθ = sinθ/cosθ.
