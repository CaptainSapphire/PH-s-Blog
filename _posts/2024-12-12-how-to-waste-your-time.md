# How to completely waste your time: a short story
I am the IMC President, meaning I overlook and overview all the activities happening in the performing arts department (except theater). We had a fundraiser planned. 

## The start
As usual, OPIMA (the parent volunteers) email me the poster to distribute amongst to the google classrooms and social media. I did such. I walk into Wind Ensemble, and the director pulls up the instagram in front of the band. 
He breaks down the various typos and issues thrughout the fundraiser post among other posts. This was on me, I should have checked the poster before posting, as this is the second or third poster with issues this semester.
