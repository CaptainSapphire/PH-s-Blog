# Collaboration with the P.A. Club at Moorpark College
I am a Data Science Major attending Moorpark College. This has provided me opportunity to meet new people, experience new things, and participate in a range of extracurriculars/projects. <br><br>

## How it all began
Sometime around the beginning of October 2025, a student in my Honors General Biology 1 class passed a flyer around the class promoting the *Pre-Physician's Assistant Club of Moorpark. I texted the number listed on the flyer, offering to make them a website. <br><br>

The president, [Megan Mishkanian](https://www.linkedin.com/in/megan-mishkanian-005759276/), replied and we met up in the library. Given we wanted the website to be simple, set up/edited easy, and cheap, I suggested we use google sites. 

## The Making
From there, she sent me two posters that are representative of the font and color scheme. I used [this color picker](https://imagecolorpicker.com/) to pull the colors and their HEX values, and then put them into a custom theme on the google site. I retrieved the fonts and logo from asking the president directly. <br><Br>

<br><br>
I suggested a few different pages for the site, but we settled on 4 (Home, Past Meetings, Board, and Resources). Home for general information, past meetings for current members, and resources (since the club is meant to serve as a hub for students looking to become a P.A., it would be good to have resources available publically). <br><br>

Google Sites is relatively simple to navigate, so it was simple to set up the pages and go from there. 
<br><br>

The president, after I layed out the groundwork, made some aesthetic changes and filled in the segments I left for her to fill in (information about the club, pictures of the board, etc). It was an enjoyable team effort.

## Final Notes
Thank you to the P.A. club for providing me with the experience of making a webite with a club using a CMS like google sites.
