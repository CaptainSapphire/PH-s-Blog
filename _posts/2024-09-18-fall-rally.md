# The Fall rally is coming up!
On Friday, the first rally of the year is happening at my school. But, why is this relevant to me?

# Some Context
The rally isn't just a fun, social event for every student in the school, whether they want to go or not. It's a performance! The ASB, marching band, cheer team, color guard, and dance team all work to entertain the many students in the stands of the gym. 

# Preparation for the Performance
The marching band practice the day before, our director gave us some time to review the songs we were playing in our performance. At this rally, We were playing *Dance the Night* and *Alma Mater*. We held light discussions as to plans and went into the next day. 
<br><br>
We were to be dismissed from our 4th period class to give the marching band time to warm up and prepare for the rally. The performance itself is quite short. Nevertheless, tuning and warming up is a necessity to provide a high-quality performance. 

# The actual day
I have Wind Ensemble during 4th period, so I did not need to be given an early dismissal, as my instrument was already out, and I was in the band room. As the group was given an early dissmissal, I pulled out my pep book and lyre. 
<br> A **pep book** is an envelope, cut and fortified with tape, that holds all of a marcher's pep tunes. 
<br> A **lyre** holds the pep music/pep book on the arm of a flutist/Sousaphonist, or on the instrument of a trumpet, clarinet, baritone, etc.
