# My Experience Working as a CS TA
Hey everyone, it's been a while. I took a short break for finals, but I am back to blog posting now. :) <br><br>
I worked as [Mr. Sanchez's](https://sites.google.com/opusd.us/mr-sanchez/home) TA for his [Computer Science Principles](https://apstudents.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-computer-science-principles) class. 
The question coming out of it as I graduate is what I experienced, and what I took away from it.

## What is a TA?
A Teacher's Assistant (T.A.) is a student who is aiding the teacher in a range of different tasks. Some teachers have their T.A.s grade papers, while others file them.
The band director had the T.A.s manage the google classroom and help teach students, and the AP Lang TA has them do almost everything except teach (from what I've heard). 
Depending on the field you're going into, it can be really helpful to work as a T.A. for a teacher. <br><br>
For example, it helps your own skills and understanding of a subject to teach others that subject, which is why they are often tutors or guides. 

## The Experiences
[After I got approved to become his TA](https://captainsapphire.github.io/PH-s-Blog/blog/2024/08/08/Becoming-TA.html), I would ask him each class what I could help with, which ended up being a range of different tasks. 
### Researching topics and getting him materials
Oftentimes he would want me to research something, and then return some type of product to him. Here are a few examples. <br><br>
1. **Python Code Loop** <br><br>
!["Code I wrote"](https://github.com/CaptainSapphire/PH-s-Blog/blob/main/assets/May%202025/Screenshot%202025-05-16%20142146.png?raw=true)
He asked me to write a python recursion loop (which is something the students need to do for the AP Exam) to teach them what it is. So, I wrote a beginner friendly loop with comments somewhat explaining what I was doing. I uploaded it to replit (now deleted because of their new policies) and emailed it to him as well. <br><Br>

2. **Giraffe Academy Code Snippets** <br><br>
He had me take the code snippets from a giraffe academy course and make an answer keep for the students. I re-color coded it and emailed back to him an 18 page doc. As interesting as it is, I'd reccomend just going though the course on your own time. :)

3. **CyberPatriot**
At one point he wanted to make a team or club to participate in the U.S. cyberpatriot activites.
