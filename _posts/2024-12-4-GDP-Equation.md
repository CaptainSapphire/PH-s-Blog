# GDP Equation Review

The GDP equation is a macroeconomic model used to find the Gross Domestic Product for a region. The teacher told us that the GDP equation will be on our test on Thursday, so here's a quick review for studying's sake.

## The Basics
```
GDP = C + I + G + (X - M)
```
The equation above has a lot of variables, but what do they mean? <br><br>
- GDP = What we are solving for
- C = Consumer Spending
- I = Business Expenditures
- G = Government Spending
- (X-M) = Foreign Sector/Trade Balance
- X = Exports
- M = Imports

## How to Remember the Variables
All of the variables except one the first/second letter matches the variable letter. C = **C**onsumer Spending, for example. Focus instead on remebering the I. The teacher even told us, he's going to add "investments" and "intermediate spending" to throw us off, but the I is Business expenditures. 

## Let's Do a Practice Problem
```
Consumer spending = 26 mil
Government spending = 50 mil
secondhand spending = 14 mil
imports = 24 mil
exports = 14 mil
business expenditures = 10 mil
intermediate spending = 23 mil
investments = 56 mil
```
<br> *these numbers are made up for practice.*<br><br>
We have a whole lot of numbers here, but don't confuse yourself! Only look for those that fit into our equation. First, our C, or consumer spending. <br><br>
```
GDP = C + I + G + (X - M)
GDP = 26 mil + I + G + (X - M)
```
Next, our BUSINESS EXPENDITURES.
```
GDP = 26 mil + I + G + (X - M)
GDP = 26 mil + 10 mil + G + (X - M)
```
Then, our government spending.
```
GDP = 26 mil + 10 mil + G + (X - M)
GDP = 26 mil + 10 mil + 50 mil + (X - M)
```
Finally, our foreign sector, aka, our trade balance. Our imports and our exports. 
```
GDP = 26 mil + 10 mil + 50 mil + (X - M)
GDP = 26 mil + 10 mil + 50 mil + (14 mil - 24 mil)
```
Now put it all in your calculator, and you should get 76 million dollars (for your answer.)

## Finishing Notes
Thank you for reading, and wish me luck on the econ test! I might make another post to review, but we shall see. Here's a little comic I made about it, and see you next time :)
