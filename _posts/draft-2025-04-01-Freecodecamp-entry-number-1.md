# FreeCodeCamp Entry #1

# Introduction/Updates
Hello everyone, first blog post of 2025! We're going to continue our weekly posts as our resolution, and get at least a certification a month! ðŸ¥³<br><br>

Today's entry is about my FreeCodeCamp journey; I completed the HTML/CSS certification prior to even the making of this blog, but I never got to finish the rest of the courses. 
So, recently I picked up the **JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures** certification. <br><br>
The first course **Learn Introductory JavaScript by Building a Pyramid Generator**
