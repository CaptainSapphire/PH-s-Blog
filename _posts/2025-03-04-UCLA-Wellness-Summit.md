# 2025 UCLA Gen Z Mental Health and Wellness Summit (and my Sunday)
This Sunday, I went with a friend to the *UCLA Gen Z Mental Health and Wellness Summit.* 
I discovered this event through the weekly Oak Park High School emails, and signed up; I want to be a UCLA student and the activities caught my interest. <br><br>

# Before the event
My friend met me at my house around 8:30 AM, and we arrived at about 9:00 AM (right when check-in opens.) <br><br>
We exited the parking structure having no idea where we were or where we needed to go (other than the "Ackerman Union"). However, a volunteer for the event
immediately approached us and directed us to a staircase nearby. By coincidence, we were right where we needed to be. We make our way through the building, following the sides, and check in at a table of student volunteers. <br><br>
The venue was very nice, with large windows providing all of the light. Despite having opened 10 minutes ago, a good deal of guests waited in the breakfast line. My friend and I waited there as well. It was worth it, the continental breakfast tasted delicious. <br><br>

# The first half
At 10, we sat at a table with a family and the event started. <br><br>
<img src="https://github.com/CaptainSapphire/PH-s-Blog/blob/main/assets/March%202025/ucla_2.jpeg?raw=true" alt="Livestream link" style= "float: left; padding-right:10px" width="300"/> The first session was part of the general session, called "Perception Box" by Elizabeth Koch. "Explore your Perception Box™—a framework developed by Elizabeth Koch, visionary leader and founder of Unlikely Collaborators, to help describe the beliefs, experiences, and biases that shape your perception and interactions" - UCLA website page <br><br>
Elizabeth Koch uses [the perception box analogy](https://www.tinybluedotfoundation.org/perception-box). Her presentation style reminded me of my English teacher, a friendly, primary school teacher energy. She was a good way to open the morning. <br><br>
She introduced the idea of the perception box or the lens in which we view ourselves, others, and the world. Hence, perception. Box, because it is limited to us. Then, she had all of the "perception box adventure" stands around the room unveil their veils, to reveal a bunch of little goodies at each stand. She said to "grab five items that stand out to you, or trigger some emotional response." <br><br>
I grabbed:
<li>1. A plastic spaceship: It reminded me of my friends, who all enjoy the Microsoft flight simulator.</li>
<li>2. A plant magnet: My mother loves plants and has a garden, so it reminded me of her.</li>
<li>3. A lizard toy: I've liked these since I was a kid. We have a lot of lizards around the house. </li>
<li>4. A flute charm: I play the flute and it's really small but really cute. </li>
<li>5. A squishy star: I got one similar at a marching band banquet, and I like stars. </li>
There's not a whole lot of deep meaning behind any of it, but at least a little. We then shared what we chose with our table. The family was nice, although I didn't know how to talk to them well. The main takeaway I got was the story we we tell ourselves about the world is in our hands and everyone may have a different perception and a different story but that doesn't make them any less valid. She did clarify that just because it is valid that doesn't mean it is true. Nonetheless it was a very eye-opening and inspirational talk by Elizabeth.

<br><br>
Magician and public speaker,  Harris III, did the next segment "Learning to Start with Wow™- Storytelling and Resilience." On Eventbrite, it is described as "Harris III will help awaken your wonder and curiosity to reimagine the story you are meant to live and lead others to do the same. Award-winning illusionist, creative entrepreneur, and best-selling author Harris III will show you how to use your creativity to win in life and create a better future for yourself and our world. Harris is the host of a top 1% podcast in the world, The WOW-Level Life." <br><br>

Harrison III certainly surprised me. He began his story from when he received a magicians tool kit at a young age as a gift from his grandmother. He then went around doing magic shows, and eventually he began getting paid for it. In fact, he worked his way up to a point where he was very well known for his magic tricks. he had gotten about $1 million from this expedition by his early 20s. However, a year later, all of it was gone. <br><br>
he said "I had gotten lost in trying to be what I felt I should be or needed to be. I constantly needed it and craved the approval and validation of that crowd, even when I wasn't on stage. I tried to live the life by driving the right cars, and living the right places, and talking into the right people." <br><br>
He had lost his sense of self and identity within the fame that had to take time in order to recover that. <br><br>
One day he was going to do a magic show in some high school and some gymnasium on some day. It didn't feel any special to him except when the principal asked him to tell his story and not just do magic tricks. On how Harris III broke out of that "perception box" or how Harris turned his story around.<br><br>


# Lunch


# Em Beihold
I was incredibly excited about this segment. To be frank, she's the main reason I signed up for this event in the first place. The UCLA Eventbrite described it as: <br><br>
```
For singer-songwriter, Em Beihold, music opens a conduit to all those emotions we think about constantly but are often too nervous or afraid to say aloud in everyday conversation. With a sharp pen and infectious voice, she takes all the awkwardness, anxiety, stress, hesitancy, and uncertainty of everyday life and turns it into pretty, yet punchy pop music. It’s like she’s making sense of her mental health in real-time, layering diary-style lyrical confessions over sunny piano and bright beat-craft.

```
This section of this post will be super biased. I was introduced to her music my sophomore year, with her song ["Too Precious"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHNCHjmFSck). However, she's most well known for her song "Numb Little Bug," having blown up as an audio on TikTok. <br><br>
A psychiatrist talked to her about her experience with clinical depression, medication, seeking help, and her sudden rise to fame. 

<li> <strong>Clinical Depression, Seeking Help, +& Medication:</strong> Around 2020-2021, she battled clinical depression and struggled to seek for help. However, through the support of her mother, she was able to make a recovery. She was in talking therapy for 2 years, and at that point her therapist recommended medication and other forms of therapy to make a recovery. And so, despite "Numb Little Bug" critizing the use of medication, she actually embraced medication. </strong> </li>

<li> <strong>Sudden Fame: </strong>She stated she found herself looking at what worked for other indie artists in order to keep up. She stopped making authentic music, and things true to herself and her experiences. Similar to Harris III, "If you live for approval then you will die by their rejection," in a way. This took a toll on her mental health, and she stepped away from the scene to rediscover her identity. </li>

<li><strong>Staying off social media and her experience with it:</strong> She mentioned she's been off TikTok for an entire year. For her, "Out of a hundred positive comments, I'd worry about the one negative comment" (paraphrased). For her mental health, she generally stays away from the comment section, the statistics, and the platforms themselves. </li> 

<li><strong>Returning to the stage: </strong>She's planning on making a debut album sometime soon, as it is in the works. She played "Numb Little Bug" for us. Then she played a minute of her unreleased song, "Brutus," a song about envy and jealousy. </li>

# Exploring the Campus

### Ackerman Union
The Ackerman Union is where the event was initially hosted, and where the iconic Bruin bear lives. The architecture was really nice and I don't have too much to say on it as it was our first stop and I was preoccupied mentally with the event however, I will say that it was a very pleasant way to be greeted by the campus and it felt very safe and very green.

### The Dorms
we wandered around for a bit initially and ended up at the dorms. The dorms reminded me a little bit of a neighborhood as there are people relaxing out on the front and it was very quiet. It was tall and the structure felt more homely rather than a block homing many students.

### The Fields & Stadiums
We, on our way to Royce Hall, stopped right by the fields and the stadium. there was a soccer field, a track field football field, tennis courts and more. It is very clear UCLA values their athletics.

### Royce Hall
we ended up at Royce Hall, which was a beautiful structure, probably the most gorgeous one I've seen on campus. The spires at the top and intrigued me. However, it was closed, so we couldn't explore the inside.

### Fowler's Museum
Fowler's museum was noticeably quiet and it was a little unnerving. However, exhibits were really interesting. I found the one about the wildfires the most interesting as we reside in California and we are no strangers to wildfires. what scared of the both of us as we walked around where the people who resided in the darkness to watch over the exhibit. You wouldn't notice they were there until they made a shuffle or movement. However, I thoroughly enjoyed visiting this part of UCLA and it's really nice that it was free entry for all.

### Libraries
we visited a range of libraries. A couple were closed, but a couple were also open. Often times they transitioned into classrooms and most students in there if not every student in there was in their own world, studying for chemistry or engineering or more or something else one or two of the libraries we visited were completely quiet with every person in there wearing headphones very different from libraries. I visited at community colleges, for example. something interesting I noticed was that one of the libraries had an entire floor dedicated to Anderson business masters students. 

# Going home
The drive home was nice. I typically hear about how much of a nightmare  Los Angeles traffic is, but it went okay for us. I actually ended up falling asleep funnily enough.

# The rest of the day
The rest of the night we had chicken sandwich sandwiches and we went out and played beach volleyball at our park and just talked and hung out. it was the most enjoyable evening or day of my entire February and I look forward to the opportunity to attend another UCLA event again. :-)

# Takeaways
there are many takeaways I can draw from the varying different things I saw and did that day. I included the takeaways from each speaker in the section about them to keep this part size. <br><br>
from walking the campus, I learned that it is a very nice campus most likely the most serene ones I've visited where everyone seems to have a goal in mind from the families that visit to the students that study. <br><br>
from the event itself, I took that everyone is very committed to volunteering and value mental health and wellness for all more than I have ever seen before. I greatly admire the staff, students, and parents that put on this event, and I commemorate the effort they put in to hosting. <br><br>

Thank you for reading!
