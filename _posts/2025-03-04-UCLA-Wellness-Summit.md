# 2025 UCLA Gen Z Mental Health and Wellness Summit (and my Sunday)
This Sunday, I went with a friend to the *UCLA Gen Z Mental Health and Wellness Summit.* 
I discovered this event through the weekly Oak Park High School emails, and signed up; I want to be a UCLA student and the activities caught my interest. <br><br>

# Before the event
My friend met me at my house around 8:30 AM, and we arrived at about 9:00 AM (right when check-in opens.) <br><br>
We exited the parking structure having no idea where we were or where we needed to go (other than the "Ackerman Union"). However, a volunteer for the event
immediately approached us and directed us to a staircase nearby. By coincidence, we were right where we needed to be. We make our way through the building, following the sides, and check in at a table of student volunteers. <br><br>
The venue was very nice, with large windows providing all of the light. Despite having opened 10 minutes ago, a good deal of guests waited in the breakfast line. My friend and I waited there as well. It was worth it, the continental breakfast tasted delicious. <br><br>

# The first half
At 10, we sat at a table with a family and the event started. <br><br>

"Explore your Perception Box™—a framework developed by Elizabeth Koch, visionary leader and founder of Unlikely Collaborators, to help describe the beliefs, experiences, and biases that shape your perception and interactions" - UCLA website page <br><br>
Elizabeth Koch uses [the perception box analogy](https://www.tinybluedotfoundation.org/perception-box). Her presentation style reminded me of my English teacher, a friendly, primary school teacher energy. She was a good way to open the morning. <br><br>
She introduced the idea of the perception box, or the lense in which we view ourselves, others, and the world. Hence, perception. Box, because it is limited to us. Then, she had all of the "perception box adventure" stands around the room unveil their veils, to reveal a bunch of little goodies at each stand.
