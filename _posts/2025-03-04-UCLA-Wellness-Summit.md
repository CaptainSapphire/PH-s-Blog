# 2025 UCLA Gen Z Mental Health and Wellness Summit (and my Sunday)
This Sunday, I went with a friend to the *UCLA Gen Z Mental Health and Wellness Summit.* 
I discovered this event through the weekly Oak Park High School emails, and signed up; I want to be a UCLA student and the activities caught my interest. <br><br>

# Before the event
My friend met me at my house around 8:30 AM, and we arrived at about 9:00 AM (right when check-in opens.) <br><br>
We exited the parking structure having no idea where we were or where we needed to go (other than the "Ackerman Union"). However, a volunteer for the event
immediately approached us and directed us to a staircase nearby. By coincidence, we were right where we needed to be. We make our way through the building, following the sides, and check in at a table of student volunteers. <br><br>
The venue was very nice, with large windows providing all of the light. Despite having opened 10 minutes ago, a good deal of guests waited in the breakfast line. My friend and I waited there as well. It was worth it, the continental breakfast tasted delicious. <br><br>

# The first half
At 10, we sat at a table with a family and the event started. <br><br>

"Explore your Perception Box™—a framework developed by Elizabeth Koch, visionary leader and founder of Unlikely Collaborators, to help describe the beliefs, experiences, and biases that shape your perception and interactions" - UCLA website page <br><br>
Elizabeth Koch uses [the perception box analogy](https://www.tinybluedotfoundation.org/perception-box). Her presentation style reminded me of my English teacher, a friendly, primary school teacher energy. She was a good way to open the morning. <br><br>
She introduced the idea of the perception box or the lens in which we view ourselves, others, and the world. Hence, perception. Box, because it is limited to us. Then, she had all of the "perception box adventure" stands around the room unveil their veils, to reveal a bunch of little goodies at each stand. She said to "grab five items that stand out to you, or trigger some emotional response." <br><br>
I grabbed:
<li>1. A plastic spaceship: It reminded me of my friends, who all enjoy the Microsoft flight simulator.</li>
<li>2. A plant magnet: My mother loves plants and has a garden, so it reminded me of her.</li>
<li>3. A lizard toy: I've liked these since I was a kid. We have a lot of lizards around the house. </li>
<li>4. A flute charm: I play the flute and it's really small but really cute. </li>
<li>5. A squishy star: I got one similar at a marching band banquet, and I like stars. </li>
There's not a whole lot of deep meaning behind any of it, but at least a little. We then shared what we chose with our table. The family was nice, although I didn't know how to talk to them well. The main takeaway I got was...

<br><br>
Magician and public speaker,  Harris III, did the next segment "Learning to Start with Wow™- Storytelling and Resilience." On Eventbrite, it is described as "Harris III will help awaken your wonder and curiosity to reimagine the story you are meant to live and lead others to do the same. Award-winning illusionist, creative entrepreneur, and best-selling author Harris III will show you how to use your creativity to win in life and create a better future for yourself and our world. Harris is the host of a top 1% podcast in the world, The WOW-Level Life."

# Em Beihold
I was incredibly excited about this segment. To be frank, she's the main reason I signed up for this event in the first place. The UCLA Eventbrite described it as: <br><br>
```
For singer-songwriter, Em Beihold, music opens a conduit to all those emotions we think about constantly but are often too nervous or afraid to say aloud in everyday conversation. With a sharp pen and infectious voice, she takes all the awkwardness, anxiety, stress, hesitancy, and uncertainty of everyday life and turns it into pretty, yet punchy pop music. It’s like she’s making sense of her mental health in real-time, layering diary-style lyrical confessions over sunny piano and bright beat-craft.

```
This section of this post will be super biased. I was introduced to her music my sophomore year, with her song ["Too Precious"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHNCHjmFSck). However, she's most well known for her song "Numb Little Bug," having blown up as an audio on TikTok. <br><br>
A psychiatrist talked to her about her experience with clinical depression, medication, seeking help, and her sudden rise to fame. 

<li> <strong>Clinical Depression +& Medication:</strong> </li>

<li><strong>Seeking Help:</strong> </li> 

<li> <strong>Sudden Fame:</strong>She stated she found herself looking at what worked for other indie artists in order to keep up. She stopped making authentic music, and things true to herself and her experiences. Similar to Harris III, "If you live for approval then you will die by their rejection," in a way. This took a toll on her mental health, and she stepped away from the scene to rediscover her identity. </li>
