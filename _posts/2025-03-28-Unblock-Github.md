# OPHS: Unblock Github
Sometime in the past month or so, the high school I attend has blocked github. 

## What is Github?

By a DuckDuckGo search, *"GitHub is a proprietary developer platform that allows developers to create, store, manage, and share their code. 
It uses Git to provide distributed version control and GitHub itself provides access control, bug tracking, software feature requests, task management, continuous integration, and wikis for every project. 
Headquartered in California, GitHub, Inc. has been a subsidiary of Microsoft since 2018."* <br><br>
It's also what I use to upload my blog posts and host my website. 

## Why it should be unblocked
