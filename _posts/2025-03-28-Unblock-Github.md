# OPHS: Unblock Github
Sometime in the past month or so, the high school I attend has blocked github. 

## What is Github?

By a DuckDuckGo search, *"GitHub is a proprietary developer platform that allows developers to create, store, manage, and share their code. 
It uses Git to provide distributed version control and GitHub itself provides access control, bug tracking, software feature requests, task management, continuous integration, and wikis for every project. 
Headquartered in California, GitHub, Inc. has been a subsidiary of Microsoft since 2018."* <br><br>
It's also what I use to upload my blog posts and host my website. 

## Why did it get blocked?
I do not have the exact reason why it got blocked. However, most IDEs are blocked on my school account and/or wifi. <br><br>
*An integrated development environment is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities for software development. An IDE normally consists of at least a source-code editor, build automation tools, and a debugger.* <br><br>
They automatically block any .io websites as many games are run on .io. However, some .io's are IDEs as well. Non .io's are blocked because you could run an environment in browser
