# A Lesson Learned: The SAT
I took the October 5th SAT and learned a lesson the hard way.
## Signing up for the SAT
Mid-September, I went to register for the SAT. Why I didn't do it sooner? I focused my time and energy into other things. The wrong things. I registered, and I got the last open spot that was nearby. I was so unbelievably lucky. 
## The morning
**The time might be off, but the minutes between are accurate.*<br><br>
I got everything I needed together: Driver's license, water bottle, pencils, calculator, and my Chromebook. I put it all in my purse and said goodbye to both of my parents. It started at 8:30 am, and I left at around 8:00 am. The high school I was taking it at I had never been there before, and I had checked the day before, it was 15 minutes away. <br><br>
I drove myself and arrived around 8:15am. I got the last open spot in the parking lot. I had about 15 minutes to find the classroom and get set up for the SAT.<br><br>
I ran up a set of stairs and asked one of the kids going into one of the classrooms where the room sheet was. He said it was below the stairs, by the library entrance. An East Asian girl ahead of him in line turned back and jumped in to help. She explain how to get to the library, where exactly the list was posted, and to ask the IT guy. <br><br>
I sped-walked down the stairs and down the hall to a wide building with both doors unlocked. I went inside and spotted a kid from my school, who's in the String Orchestra. It was nice spotting I recognized, despite the fact I know nothing about this guy. He was recieving IT help. After He recieved his help, the IT guy showed me the list and directed me to the class.<br><br>
"It's the first building you hit if you run down this hall, up the stairs on the left, the classroom to the furthest right on that second floor."<br><br>
I thanked him and sprinted. I got to the line, somewhat out of breath, on time. 
## The Lesson 
You got there on time, Priya. What's the issue? <br><br>
Well, I was lucky. I got lucky getting the registration spot, and I got lucky getting that parking spot. I was fortunate that the students and staff were willing to help me get to where I needed to go. Next time, I plan to do everything much earlier, especially on important occasions as such
