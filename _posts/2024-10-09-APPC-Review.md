# APPC QUICK REVIEW!
I've got a test in AP Precalculus in about an hour, so it's time for a quick review!!

## Holes
```
(x)(x+3)/(x+3)(x+4)
```
Holes are the numbers that can be simplified from the top and bottom of a polynomial function. So, (x+3) can be eliminated from top and bottom, making a hole at (-3,?). 
To find the y-value, plug the x-value in the simplified equation.
```
(x)/(x+4) --> (-3)/(-3+4) --> -3/1 --> y value = -3
```

## Vertical Asymptotes
```
(x)(x+3)/(x+3)(x+4)
```
x=-4 would be a vertical asymptote as it is on the bottom of the polynomial function and not a hole. Vertical asymptotes are lines in the function that x approaches, but never quite hits. Holes always dominate Vertical asymptotes. 

## Horizontal Asymptotes/End Behavior

### num. > den.
For this, there is no horizontal asymptote but rather a slant asymptote. For this, look at the signs of the top and bottom to see if it goes to positive or negative infinity. 

### num. = den.
The horizontal asymptote is the num/den. 
```
3x+3/2x+2 --> y = 3/2
```
### num. > den.
The horizontal asymptote is at y=0. 

## The Roots
The zeros/roots are the numbers on the top that aren't holes. 
```
(x)(x+3)/(x+3)(x+4) --> x = 0 is the root
```
## Reflection
Wish me luck on my test, thank you for reading!
