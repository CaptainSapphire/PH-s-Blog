# Making a website for my second T.A. assignment

Walking into AP Computer Science as a TA, the teacher asks me: "Can you make a site?" <br><br>
I nod, although I admit I misheard him say "Slides."

Toward the end of the class, I approach him and he gives me the directions and complete creative freedom. 
The teachers at this school need a staff website, with your contact and room number. 
So, I get started.

## Step One: Find your basis
The necessities to what is needed in a staff website are contact, room number, and classes. The other information to gather is what they want it to look like. 
In this case, he provided the example, so I was set there. The last bit I already knew, was where to build it. Every teacher at this school uses Google Sites, so I went ahead with that. 

## Step Two: Building the first draft
This step is very similar to that of drawing. If you're drawing the full body of a character, you draw the full pose first, then fill in the details.
First, make all the pages to organize how you want the information to be laid out. I went like this: 
- Home = core information
- Classes = more detailed parts, class schedules and descriptions
- About me = the teacher himself
- How to screenshot = something students need to submit their assignments, good to include as an extra resource

## Step Three: Fill in the data, and think of the consumer
As you fill in all the necessary details, think of the consumer, or potential viewers. Students and staff alike will need to email him, so it should be at the front of the home page. 
Parents will want descriptions of each class and what it entails (so add the syllabus.) Students could be curious as to what the teacher is like, so add an About Me. 
Students will need a way to access their resources later, and scrolling through Google Classroom isn't really efficient. <br><br>
That is what I personally was considering adn implementing as I made the site, so I reccomend keeping such in mind as you make yours- just a friendly tidbit of advice. 

## What did I learn?
I learned how to make a staff website with Google Sites, and how to gauge what is important to include in this sort of project. <br><br>
Thank you to everyone who reads and supports this blog, I know uploads can be irregular due to schoolwork. :)
