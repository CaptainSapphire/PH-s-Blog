# Educational Update: College So Far
Today is Tuesday, August 5th, 2025. Tommorrow, I have orientation (keep an eye out for that blog post ðŸ˜Š). I want to document my experience and thoughts on college so far, as well as my expectations. <br><br>

## Dual Enrollment
I did a little bit of dual enrollment while I was in high school- 3 classes. "Design and Society," "Introduction to Business," and "Introduction to Communications/Public Speaking." All of them were done online. <br><br>
I enjoyed each of them, and while they provided their challenges, generally, they were easy to do well in, for me. <br><br>

Read the textbook/watch the lecture, do the assignment. There is not much more to it, especially when all the resources are accessible online. I have to say that the experiences and what I learn are a little less memorable than in person, but it is still an effective method of teaching, so I am not complaining. 

## This Summer
While this summer is technically considered "dual enrollment," I think of it as a precursor to my first semester. I had three classes, but one was in person this time. I found the in-person class a lot more engaging that an online class. I also found it way easier to talk to people, as I got to know everyone in the class in a relatively short timespan (a month) while in high school it would take me a full semester and a half. Maybe it is the culture of high school versus college, or just me as a person having grown and changed, there are too many factors to really placate blame as to why it is different here and now. 

## Expectations
While certain classes were much easier while others were immensely harder, I can reasonably deduce that it will be a challenge. I have four classes, with only one being honors. The two honors classes I took over the summer were quite a challenge, so I figured I would take only one in order to balance my workload with the fact that this is a new phase of my life. <br><br>

## Final Thoughts
I have the [New Student Welcome](https://www.moorparkcollege.edu/departments/student-services/outreach-office/new-student-welcome) tommorrow, so I will share how that goes. I cannot wait for the semster and greater college experience to start next Monday. Thank you for reading!
