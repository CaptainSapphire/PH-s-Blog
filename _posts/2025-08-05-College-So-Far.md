# Educational Update: College So Far
Today is Tuesday, August 5th, 2025. Tommorrow, I have orientation (keep an eye out for that blog post ðŸ˜Š). I want to document my experience and thoughts on college so far, as well as my expectations. 

## Dual Enrollment
I did a little bit of dual enrollment while I was in high school- 3 classes. "Design and Society," "Introduction to Business," and "Introduction to Communications/Public Speaking." All of them were done online. <br><br>
I enjoyed each of them, and while they provided their challenges, generally, they were easy to do well in, for me. <br><br>
