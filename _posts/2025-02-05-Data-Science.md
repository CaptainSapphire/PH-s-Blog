# Changing Majors.

# It's time to tell a story. 
Once upon a time, there was a girl attending Oak Hills Elementary. Then she attends Medea Creek Middle School. For all of that time, she believed she was going to be a doctor. An anesthesiologist. 
**Then, in the span of what felt like two weeks, her world collapsed.** <br><br>
COVID hit. Kids were taken out of school and began attending from home. I was in 8th grade at the time. That year, I gained access to free internet for the first time, and I fell down the rabbit hole of YouTube. <br><br>

She learned so many things from so many communities. There are people out there, like her. There, an idea was planted in her head, one that would change the course of her life forever (that's a bit dramatic, even for me).<br><br>

**Your life is your own.** <br><br>

I realized I never wanted to do med on my own. It wasn't an industry I wanted to work in, and I respect those who did. But this world was told to me to be the best option. And I wanted to be *the best* just like any other kid.<br><br>
From there, I learned about the successful, lucrative, enjoyable computer science industry. It wasn't just one thing, it was a statue with big, wide arms. Programming, marketing, product management, and teaching- it felt like every aspect of life was touched by computer science. So, I stepped into high school with a bag on my back and a goal in my mind. To be a star with Computer Science. 
<br><br>
Throughout high school, I took courses to learn programming and computer science. FreeCodeCamp, CodeAvengers, GirlsWhoCode, especially. <br><br>
Then, senior year, I felt something shift in the Computer Science industry. OpenAI releases ChatGPT, and China drops Deepseek. Technology is constantly changing and evolving, and in Computer Science you have to constantly be up to date skill wise. I feel stressed following, or trying to follow what's happening. <br><br>

I'm not here to bash Computer Science but to recognize its flaws. The constant stress or pressure to be on top because of how saturated the field is and how much it covers (AI, machine learning, software development, frontend, backend, product management, programming, blog posts, etc etc etc...) became clear to me this year. I want to work and feel stable, and I think fighting to be enough all of the time is not the kind of environment I'd like to work in. <br><br>
So it has flaws, big deal. Is this still where I want to work though, and is there maybe something else that works better for me? <br><br>
Short answer yes, long answer... <br><br>

# Introduction to Data Science (in relation to Computer Science)

Data Science seems to take the aspects of what I like most of Computer Science and focus on them. In particular, Python. I took the Data Science courses GirlsWhoCodeoffered in their Self Paced Program last year
