#First Football Game of the Year: I was nervous!

Performances are not uncommon, by your senior year of high school. However, for our show, The Moon Race, there was reason for fear.<br><br>

Leading into the game, I marched the entire woodwind group into arcs, for us to perform the *Star Spangled Banner in Ab* to the crowd as the football players ran onto the field. <br><br>

Prior to this, during our rehearsal, our director had us practice this lead-in. I was excited and incredibly nervous! I was in charge of ensuring the setup for the SSB was satisfactory. 
To be honest, I hadn't been this nervous for an extensive period of time! I was excitable, and making wild gestures to my mother, who was volunteering and oh so confused.
