# First Football Game of the Year: I was nervous!

Performances are not uncommon, by your senior year of high school. However, for our show, The Moon Race, there was reason for fear.<br><br>

Leading into the game, I marched the entire woodwind group into arcs, for us to perform the *Star Spangled Banner in Ab* to the crowd as the football players ran onto the field. <br><br>

Prior to this, during our rehearsal, our director had us practice this lead-in. I was excited and incredibly nervous! I was in charge of ensuring the setup for the SSB was satisfactory. 
To be honest, I hadn't been this nervous for an extensive period! I was excitable, and making wild gestures to my mother, who was volunteering and oh so confused.

## Marching on and playing pep tunes proceeded as normal, with mild alterations given we have a different director this year. The real challenge came at half-time.

 The lights beamed down upon each of our plumes as we warmed our instruments against the chilly field. Half-time is when the cheer, dance, and marching band will perform for the audience before the game resumes. On Friday, the marching band was up first.

For some context, there were a number of factors that made us increasingly nervous in comparison to other year's first football game performances. 
1. The first football game was early! Typically, the season starts later on, and we only perform movement 1. However, this year on the third week of school we are performing movement one and two.
2. The show can use some work. I enjoy the show and the progress we've made, I do not deny this. Nevertheless, the runs of the show were weak, and it was very much a draft.
3. It was the first time doing our show without gacs. Gacs are dots painted on the field that mark our spot. We only have gacs on the lower field, so at performances we won't have them. It's key that performers get the oppurtunity to practice without them before a performance. It's like training wheels; you need to be able to go without them, given in a race you couldn't use them.
