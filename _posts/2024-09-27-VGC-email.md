# VGC First Meeting Prep!

VGC, the Video Game Creation Club, is a club that makes video games! I started it last year, and it's time this year to prep for a new year. 
## The Initial Email
!["Initial email"](https://github.com/CaptainSapphire/PH-s-Blog/blob/main/assets/September%202024/vgc-email.png?raw=true)
*For privacy, several parts of this email are blurred.*
Here's the email I sent out to the entire club! Let's break it down.
## Breaking it down
We're taking it, we're taking it, we're takin it down- Fireball! Wait, wrong extracurricular. 
### Opening Statement
```
Hello everyone,

It's time for the first club meeting of the Video Game Creation Club! I am so happy to see all the sign-ups, I can't wait to work with you all this year. ðŸš€
```
A positive greeting is necessary to introduce any email- it's basic etiquette! In fact, another blog post of mine goes into more depth on the subject.
### 5 Ws
Covering the most important subject of the email at the start refrains from wasting the time of the person who is reading. The room, date, and time are all listed, in bold, in one sentence.  
### Discord
Discord is the hub we use for much of our communications. Votes are held in #vote and announcements in # announcements. The first vote encourages new members to participate in their first club activity. 
### Meeting Agenda
This allows members, old and new, to know what to expect next Wednesday. 
### Remind
These reminders can be important, especially to members who forget about club meetings! School is often a lot, so you can never truly blame those who forget. Rather, helping them out with Remind is the best course of action.
### Closing thoughts
Honestly, I do not have a lot to say. I can't wait for this year of VGC, and thank you for reading!
