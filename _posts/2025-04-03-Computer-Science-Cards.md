# Study Cards I made last year
Last year, I took the AP Computer Science Principles Exam. I made some cards for review of some topics that I had struggled on/had an interest in. Let's take a look!

## Abstraction

This is a key term I saw constantly last year. It's in a lot of the code as well; procedures need to be complex, and demonstrate some form of abstraction, which you could do with just nesting if statements in if statements. It's a vital concept rather than just a key term. 

## Bandwidth
