# Study Cards I made last year
Last year, I took the AP Computer Science Principles Exam. I made some cards for review of some topics that I had struggled on/had an interest in. Let's take a look!

## Abstraction

This is a key term I saw constantly last year. It's in a lot of the code as well; procedures need to be complex, and demonstrate some form of abstraction, which you could do with just nesting if statements in if statements. It's a vital concept rather than just a key term. 

## Bandwidth

Have you ever been on discord?<br><br>
If so, you've seen this before. !["discord bandwidth patrol"](https://preview.redd.it/how-do-i-turn-this-off-v0-8eg06gfur7ed1.jpeg?auto=webp&s=fb71eafef9b6d7150c25b42aa7177000128dd949)<br><br>
Data being transferred at certain speeds is something important to... everything. If a webpage takes too long to load, you close it and that business has lost your business. If the StarBucks wifi you're on is too slow, the data isn't coming to you fast enough, you go to the library instead.
