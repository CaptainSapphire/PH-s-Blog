# Day #1 of "Algorithm Analysis" with FreeCodeCamp

## Context
Hello everyone! In Quincy Larson's weekly resources, he shared a particular [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) course, specifically "[Why Algorithms Work â€“ Algorithm Analysis Deep Dive Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku6HZ_k9qgY). As a Data Science Major, I figured it was worth checking out, so here is what I have learned on Day one! 


## What I've learned
**Algorithm**:
- A well defined, finite procedure that takes input and produces an output, an effective method for solving problems

**Time Complexity**:
- The amount of time for an algorithm to run
- Important in real world applications: Google produces many results in short time
- How to measure the efficiency of code --> how do we measure speed --> can we use actual time? (are the algorithms being tested on the same system)> --> How about the steps to run?
