# Volunteering at the Choir Variety Show: How did it go?

# Context
I am a student at OPHS, and I am the president of the performing arts student body (IMC). This means I must attend any performances hosted at the high school and support the program. 
One event the department puts on every spring is the Choir Variety Show. All 3-4 choir groups perform a set of tunes with each other, and students create barbershops/do solos/duets as well. 

# How it went
I drove to the school and arrived at around 6:30 pm. I updated the Emcee doc first.
<br><br>
The emcee document is a document that is displayed on a monitor in front of the emcees. This document displays a list of topics to be announced to the viewers, be a simple "check out concessions!" or "sign up for OPIMA (parent volunteering)!" I then ran over to the pavilion and grabbed 4 programs; 2 for emcees, 2 for AV/Tech. <br><br>
I went around getting pictures for social media
