# Volunteering at the Choir Variety Show: How did it go?

# Context
I am a student at OPHS, and I am the president of the performing arts student body (IMC). This means I have to attend any performances that the department hosts at the high school, and support the program. 
One event the department puts on every spring is the Choir Variety Show. All 3-4 choir groups perform a set of tunes with each other, and students create barbershops/do solos/duets as well. 

# How it went
I drove to the school and arrived at around 6:30 pm.
