# Volunteering at the Choir Variety Show: How did it go?

# Context
I am a student at OPHS and the president of the performing arts student body (IMC). As such, I must attend any performances hosted at the high school and support the program. 
One event the department puts on every spring is the Choir Variety Show. All 3-4 choir groups perform a set of tunes with each other, and students create barbershops/do solos/duets as well. 

# How it went
I drove to the school and arrived at around 6:30 pm. I updated the Emcee doc first.
<br><br>
The emcee document is a document that is displayed on a monitor in front of the emcees. This document displays a list of topics to be announced to the viewers, be it a simple "check out concessions!" or "sign up for OPIMA (parent volunteering)!" I then ran over to the pavilion and grabbed 4 programs; 2 for emcees, 2 for AV/Tech. <br><br>
I went around getting pictures for social media and historians with what time remained.<br><br>

*I made an Instagram post on the Oak Park Music account to hype up the live stream a little bit.* <br><br>
Once that was done, I sat down with AV/Tech and there was a bit of chaos with the live stream, from microphones to audio mixing, but once all was said and done, we all enjoyed the show from the band room. <br><br>
At one point I had to run to the pavilion to let the AV/Tech lead know that the microphones were working and we mistook the timing for the start of "Pretty & Popular." I think the speed at which I took off to let the lead know so we can avoid adjusting mics on a mistake scared them a little bit. They were all wide-eyed when I got back. But, I wanted to run anyway, so it worked out for me. <br><br>
After that, I updated the band room calendar, and then enjoyed the rest of the show until intermission. During intermission, I reminded AV/Tech about interviews and then went off to recruit interviewees. After that, the show seemed pretty settled down, so I went home and enjoyed what remained of the performance via livestream. <br><br>

The choir is a lot less chaotic and problemed in comparison to concerts. Whatever they do differently, they are better at following directions/listening and are more systematic and organized. The band concerts aren't bad by any means, but I notice that the choir events rarely have an occasion where a performer forgets their attire or talks behind the stage. It's interesting, although not much.

# Final Thoughts
I enjoyed helping, in whatever ways I could. The choir did an amazing job, and my favorite song was the duet "Pretty & Popular" from Wicked. Be sure to check out the stream, and thank you for reading :)
