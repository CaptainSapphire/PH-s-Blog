# Unlocking Creativity with AI: Express Your Unique Inner Music Through AI with RTX

## Context
Girls Who Code is a company who uplifts girls in STEM, and right now, I am in their Pathways Program. Every week, they host events with the company's partners. Monday, July 21st, the event is called "Unlocking Creativity with AI: Express Your Unique Inner Music Through AI with RTX." RTX is a multinational conglomerate mostly managing technologies. Their main products are aircraft engines, avionics, mission systems, and integrated defense systems, but they also work in software.

**The basics of AI**
- 70,000 companies (as of April 2025) are developing AI models

prompt engineering: art of asking AI the right way. Needs to be clear, specific, and structured. 
- Had to write a story, then lyrics, both using copilot
<br><br>
After that practice activity, we split into breakout rooms to make our own song.
- Generate a song cover via copilot
- Make the actual song with [Suno](https://suno.com/home)
