# GWC Workshop #2: Powering Your Project with IBM SkillsBuild
Hey! I'm a data science major, a freshman in college, and a member of [Girls Who Code](https://girlswhocode.com/).  As a part of their Upskill series, they host workshops for Girls Who Code members to gain the technical skills necessary to reach their goals in STEM. On Oct 7, 2025 03:00 PM Pacific Time, I attended their second workshop! It centered around their collaboration with IBM, and this season's GWC Challenge. <br><br>

**IBM SkillsBuild** <br><Br>
Nice thing to note: They took a poll on the experience of the attendees of the workshop on their level of experience with SkillsBuild, to tailor our experience! <br><br>
- Great source of free resources!!
- Tools for all ages, career stage, and skill level
- Human skills are necessary to curate the AI as a tool
- "78% of IT roles require AI skills" (according to presentation)

**SkillsBuild + GWC Challenge** <br><br>
- GWC has prepared a special learning plan on SkillsBuild with resources to help develop your project for the challenge!
- To be eligible for the prize, submit one challenge in the learning plan per person/participant
<br><Br>
*In the GWC learning Plan, activites are sorted by project stage:*
1. "I need an idea": learn more about Cybersecurity + AI in general
2. "I have an idea and want to grow my backgroud knowledge": deeper dive into Cybersecurity + AI specifics
3. "I need support building my project": skill up to build a project that goes beyond your own expectations!

**Breakout Rooms** <br><br>
We were put in breakout rooms for two minutes to talk to other members of GWC and to brainstorm some ideas! Here's who I met: 
- [Samantha O' Connell](https://www.linkedin.com/in/samantha-oconnell): Has a background in ISM with some beginner experience in computer science and cybersecurity. My focus is in HCI, IS, and UTAUT.
- Victora Chang: Originally a computer science major but now a informatics major because she enjoys working with UX design/frontend.

**Setting up the Resources** <br><br>
- They showed how to signup with IBM SkillsBuild, reccomending singing up with Google and filling out the information it asks for.
- Make sure the organization says Girls Who Code
- Enroll into learning plan
- mark activity as complete when activity is completed
- Showed how to navigate settings

**Coworking Time** <br><br>
- Room 1: QnA about challenge w/ Joe
- Room 2: QnA about SkillsBuild/IBM Jefersson 

I went to the SkillsBuild QnA:
- All content, certificates, certification exams are free
- "What are some tips you recommend for this challenge in combining AI + cybersecurity" --> Block your calendar, concentrate, complete learning plan, PLAN YOUR PROJECT!
<br><br>
After that we reconvenced in the main room to discuss and regroup for questions, with the host asking everyone what we're excited about and whatnot. Hopefully I can attend the next event, and if I do keep an eye for my blog post :)
