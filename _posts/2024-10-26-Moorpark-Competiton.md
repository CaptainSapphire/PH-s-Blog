# The First competition: Moorpark!
Last Saturday, the Oak Park Eagle Brigade (OPB) went to our first competition: The Moorpark Competition. 

## A Breakdown
After I arrived at the school roughly 3 minutes before call time (12:15), I checked in with uniform managers. I put on my bibber [(lower half of a marching band uniform)](https://stanbury.com/products/ultra-bibbers-28-inseam-shorter-length) and checked if I could perform the dance break of movement 4 in the bibber. I was able to, though we used the strap on the inside of the hat to keep the hats on for this show. I checked in with my section to see if they had everything and then used what remaining time I had to talk with my friends. <br><br>
A little while later, Mr. Borquez (performing arts/band director) calls us to standing-by and we listen in. He double-checks with each section that they all have their instruments and equipment. The flutes are typically on top of it, so there was little concern coming from me. Plus, I already checked with them. He then dismisses the larger instruments to put their instruments in the compartment under the bus. I mingled with the flutes and clarinets before Mr. Borquez then dismissed us. I helped my friend carry his hat boxes to the bus and became the last senior to enter the bus. Fortunately, they still honored seniority, so it was fine. <br><br>
I sat across and with my friends. On the bus ride there, Mr. Borquez had us run through the show in our heads. Once the timer was up, we went back to chatting. <br><br>
Once we got on campus, pit unloaded their equipment. I spent more time with my friends before going and figuring out how I was to take my prop onto the field. <br><br>
I have a half-moon (filled in on the right side), and I put it on the 30-yard line, on the home hash. It's a very easy-to-spot dot. Mr. Borquez instructed us to not leave our props from then on. There are 12 props, and it was flutes, clarinets, and some of brass carrying them on. It would've been easier as a count to have the saxophones help, however, from a field standpoint, it is indeed better to have some members of brass assist. We then went to warm-ups. Mr. Borquez made an exception to the rule and had us leave the props with the rest of the equipment. <br><br>
Warm-ups went fine, I was somewhat preoccupied. My friend from the yearbook was going to take performance pictures, which we need. The historians are either performing or not here to get those pictures. Additionally, we lack high-quality images, and the yearbook has fancy cameras. I sent him all the information, itinerary, map, and performance times. I'm not sure how helpful it was, but I should've done that earlier. Regardless, he did show up and get those pictures. Another yearbook member crashed the party, and regardless of whatever drama that was from or caused, I got the pictures I needed from them. <br><br>

Then, the prop people went with the pit, taking all our equipment around the school. It was a long walk, but I didn't mind. It eased my nerves and gave me some time to think. Typically, I don't like long spans of time with room for thought, but I suppose this one was fine. We took our places on the side of the field. Brandon and I lined our props up. It was all fine. <br><br>
We had a moment of panic though. Typically, we go on the field, warm up at the center, and then go to our dots. With our props, what were we to do? Drop them off and run into arcs? Take them into warm-ups? We also never discussed how we were to go onto the field. Brandon assured to just "do whatever all the other prop people do." Not a great plan, I told him. Though, better than nothing. The woodwind coach came over and said "I never did an on-field warm-up before any of my marching band performances at TOHS." This is Oak Park, I can't say I had any confidence he was correct. In *my* four years, we always did one. The battery coach stated we likely won't do one, but that they'll tell us if anything changes, so whatever. <br><br>
It was finally time to take the field. I had my prop on all four wheels and started pushing my calves and walking backward. Titling it went faster, and I got the prop to its location. We were all called into an arc, and I think the director realized that we never talked about it. For a warm-up done on the fly, it went well. We all then went to our dots. 

## The Performance
At the start of movement one, I noticed the horn angle of one of my section members was lacking. I've noticed this tendency to relax the posture once the focus on the performance is drawn to a different detail. On stage, timeliness seems to be the focus. However, posture is definitely something to set straight. <br><br>
The first visual was fine, but the second was a little janky. I think establishing the timing of first count of the visual will allow a smoother transition between the move beforehand and the hold.  <br><br>

## The Rest of the Night


## The Aftermath
We are part of the 2A Green division. We placed fourth among our division. However, among 17 schools in 2A overall, we still placed 4th.
