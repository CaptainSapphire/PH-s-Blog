# Whittier Festival
I am part of the Oak Park High School's Wind Ensemble. This means, once a year, I go perform with the band at the Whittier High School Festival and recieve a ranking. 

## Getting there
Our call time was around 7am, and we all took attendance, and loaded onto the buses. My friend and I listened to music on the way there, and made basic conversation. The drive was two hours, the longest ride of any expedition I make for this program each year. 

## At the School

Upon arrival, we gather in the gym and put away our instruments and things. We then go to the concert hall to watch other groups. This is done to support the other groups and also to do our concert report.<br><br>
All of the groups did incredibly well, and one of them stood out as a much higher level than the rest. I can't recall it unfortunately, but to say each group put their all would be putting it lightly.
