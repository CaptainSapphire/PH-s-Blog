# A new study method: making videos
"You understand something when you can explain it."

## Context
Tomorrow, I have an AP Precalculus test on unit 2B. 
To study, I decided to try making tutorial videos on how to solve varying math problems. 
All of them are up on my YouTube channel or will be by the beginning of tomorrow.

## The Method
The problems stem from two resources- flippedmath.com and the worksheets that my school gives me. 
I go through all of the FlippedMath practice problems first, then I go over the mistakes I originally made, before reviewing the OPHS worksheets.
My goal is to practice working through problems, step by step. I recognize on tests, I tend to skip a lot of the steps in thinking through a problem and fumble simple things, making dumb mistakes.
