cont4ext


## Event Information
In this hands-on 90-minute session, you’ll learn how to turn AI into your personal career coach. Whether you’re applying for your first internship, your dream tech job, or anything in between, you’ll walk away with tools you can use right away.

We’ll cover three powerful ways to use AI in your job search:

AI-Powered Resume Builder: Create a polished, tailored resume that highlights your skills and experience for the role you want.
STAR Technique Interview Bot: Learn how to ace behavioral interview questions by training an AI bot to help you practice clear, confident answers.
Voice-Activated Mock Interviewer: Build your own AI-powered interviewer that can ask you questions out loud and give real-time feedback.
Along the way, we’ll explore the ethics and biases of AI in hiring, and you’ll gain practical skills you can apply for years to come. No prior AI experience required—just bring your creativity, curiosity, and career goals.

You’ll leave with:
A job-ready resume
A custom interview-prep bot for your target role
A voice-activated AI interviewer you built yourself
A clear understanding of how AI is shaping the hiring process and how you can use it to your advantage
This workshop has the opportunity for hands-on practice. If you want to build alongside others we recommend creating an account on ChatGPT or Gemini, and bringing a digital copy of your current resume or LinkedIn profile and a job posting you want to apply to. Note, this workshop will demonstrate capabilities with a paid version of ChatGPT, but the custom GPTs we build together will be shared with and usable by participants after the workshop. If you don’t have access to a paid ChatGPT plan, Gemini is currently offering a free year for college students, and Gemini Gems have similar capabilities to GPTs. Workshop participants will have the opportunity to access one free month of Replit Core after the workshop.


## Meeting notes
Crystal used AI to build mini apps to prep for:
- research the role
- tailor her resume
- make an interview rubric
- build a storytelling + interview bot

We played a game on the zoom: "AI for the Job Hunt" 
- Inventory: Resume, linkedin profile, job description, chatgpt account
- side quests: build a resume, make a STAR technique GPT, Make a mock interview bot

How can you prepare with AI?
- Choose a problem you want to solve with AI: I want to make my resume look better, I want to remove typos in my resume, I want to update my resume so it matches key themes based on this job description (choice C is the best) -->
- Go to ChatGPT and provide the job description and your resume and input the prompt above
- Review the ChatGPT output

Level 2: Make a STAR Technique GPT
- *Pro account needed
- How can I use AI to practice telling stories about my work in my interview?
- A framework good for interviewing: STAR Technique
**STAR Technique is:** <br><br>
A type of storytelling that is clear and succicent for interviewing. 
- Situation - describe the context or background
- Task - explain your role and what you needed to achieve
- Action - Detail the specific steps you took to address the task or challege
- Result - Share the outcome of your actions, ideally with measurable impact
<br><br>
Next Step:
- Ask ChatGPT to write the prompt for asking ChatGPT about the star technique...:
"now help me write a prompt to build a custom GPT or chatbot that takes stories that I tell about my work experience and reformats them to fit into the POP-IT framework"
- In pro mode go to "GPTs" on the left side tab
- Create + (in top write menu)
- Google Gemini Gems are similar to ChatGPTs GPTs (according to the host)
- [Here's the GPT Crystal made](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-68d32e7be1488191820004dfb0b6d6ac-star-technique-interview-helper)
- "If you can't find something in the menus, asking ChatGPT where it is"
- Test the functionality of the GPT 

Level 3: Make a Mock Interview Bot
- Same problem statement
- Make an interview rubric
- Get "core competencies" from ChatGPT
- Built an interview rubric scoring sheet w/ AI
- Keep in mind technical versus behavioral interview
- What kind of inputs will I need in order to build a chatbot for an interview --> we need mock questions
- Go to ChatGPT --> upload interview rubric and job desc, come up with a question guide, 30 minute interview
- “Based on this interview rubric and job description, come up with a question guide for a 30-minute interview for this role"
- [Crystal's mock interview bot](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-68d335307a58819192b2b9b75fce07e9-bethany-s-mock-interview-bot-stripe-partnerships)


*there was a few slides I did not screenshot but will be shared later in the week that I will tack onto this post.* <br><br>

They did amazing with the discussion management, despite there being 91 participants overall!

## Some Criticism on this event...
While it may feel like it is overstated, there is a need in each AI event to at least mention the potential dangers and issues with using AI. AI, beyond its environmental impacts, is a tool that can be easily misused, and I do wish I saw a bit more caution in using it to replace certain aspects of problem solving. With that said, I do not disagree that is it a very helpful tool in preparation for formal work environments like career and interview preparation, and resume making.

## Final thoughts
I thoroughly enjoyed learning from this wonderful innovator, and thank you for hosting this meeting.
