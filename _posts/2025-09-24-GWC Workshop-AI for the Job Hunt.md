## Event Information
In this hands-on 90-minute session, you’ll learn how to turn AI into your personal career coach. Whether you’re applying for your first internship, your dream tech job, or anything in between, you’ll walk away with tools you can use right away.

We’ll cover three powerful ways to use AI in your job search:

AI-Powered Resume Builder: Create a polished, tailored resume that highlights your skills and experience for the role you want.
STAR Technique Interview Bot: Learn how to ace behavioral interview questions by training an AI bot to help you practice clear, confident answers.
Voice-Activated Mock Interviewer: Build your own AI-powered interviewer that can ask you questions out loud and give real-time feedback.
Along the way, we’ll explore the ethics and biases of AI in hiring, and you’ll gain practical skills you can apply for years to come. No prior AI experience required—just bring your creativity, curiosity, and career goals.

You’ll leave with:
A job-ready resume
A custom interview-prep bot for your target role
A voice-activated AI interviewer you built yourself
A clear understanding of how AI is shaping the hiring process and how you can use it to your advantage
This workshop has the opportunity for hands-on practice. If you want to build alongside others we recommend creating an account on ChatGPT or Gemini, and bringing a digital copy of your current resume or LinkedIn profile and a job posting you want to apply to. Note, this workshop will demonstrate capabilities with a paid version of ChatGPT, but the custom GPTs we build together will be shared with and usable by participants after the workshop. If you don’t have access to a paid ChatGPT plan, Gemini is currently offering a free year for college students, and Gemini Gems have similar capabilities to GPTs. Workshop participants will have the opportunity to access one free month of Replit Core after the workshop.


## Meeting notes
Crystal used AI to build mini apps to prep for:
- research the role
- tailor her resume
- make an interview rubric
- build a storytelling + interview bot

We played a game on the zoom: "AI for the Job Hunt" 
- Inventory: Resume, linkedin profile, job description, chatgpt account
- side quests: build a resume, make a STAR technique GPT, Make a mock interview bot

How can you prepare with AI?
- Choose a problem you want to solve with AI: I want to make my resume look better, I want to remove typos in my resume, I want to update my resume so it matches key themes based on this job description (choice C is the best) -->
- Go to ChatGPT and provide the job description and your resume and input the prompt above
- Review the ChatGPT output

Level 2: Make a STAR Technique GPT
- *Pro account needed
- How can I use AI to practice telling stories about my work in my interview?
- A framework good for interviewing: STAR Technique
**STAR Technique is:** <br><br>
A type of storytelling that is clear and succicent for interviewing. 
- Situation - describe the context or background
- Task - explain your role and what you needed to achieve
- Action - Detail the specific steps you took to address the task or challege
- Result - Share the outcome of your actions, ideally with measurable impact
<br><br>
Next Step:
- Ask ChatGPT to write the prompt for asking ChatGPT about the star technique...:
"now help me write a prompt to build a custom GPT or chatbot that takes stories that I tell about my work experience and reformats them to fit into the POP-IT framework"
