## Event Information
In this hands-on 90-minute session, you’ll learn how to turn AI into your personal career coach. Whether you’re applying for your first internship, your dream tech job, or anything in between, you’ll walk away with tools you can use right away.

We’ll cover three powerful ways to use AI in your job search:

AI-Powered Resume Builder: Create a polished, tailored resume that highlights your skills and experience for the role you want.
STAR Technique Interview Bot: Learn how to ace behavioral interview questions by training an AI bot to help you practice clear, confident answers.
Voice-Activated Mock Interviewer: Build your own AI-powered interviewer that can ask you questions out loud and give real-time feedback.
Along the way, we’ll explore the ethics and biases of AI in hiring, and you’ll gain practical skills you can apply for years to come. No prior AI experience required—just bring your creativity, curiosity, and career goals.

You’ll leave with:
A job-ready resume
A custom interview-prep bot for your target role
A voice-activated AI interviewer you built yourself
A clear understanding of how AI is shaping the hiring process and how you can use it to your advantage
This workshop has the opportunity for hands-on practice. If you want to build alongside others we recommend creating an account on ChatGPT or Gemini, and bringing a digital copy of your current resume or LinkedIn profile and a job posting you want to apply to. Note, this workshop will demonstrate capabilities with a paid version of ChatGPT, but the custom GPTs we build together will be shared with and usable by participants after the workshop. If you don’t have access to a paid ChatGPT plan, Gemini is currently offering a free year for college students, and Gemini Gems have similar capabilities to GPTs. Workshop participants will have the opportunity to access one free month of Replit Core after the workshop.
