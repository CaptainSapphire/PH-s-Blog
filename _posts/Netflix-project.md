# Data Science Project: Netflix

## The start of the story
One day, I googled potential data science projects I could do, and found a reddit post with a range of links. I clicked on the one saying Netflix, since that piqued my interest. I was taken to a Medium article, which you do typically have to pay for. However, I gave the link to ChatGPT, and it gave me the summary on how to set up the project.

## Making the Presentation


## The Video + Repo
From there, I leaned the back of my computer against a wall and proped my phone on top of the laptop monitor. I recorded my screen in powerpoint, and edited it all in capcut. It's all free, and I would reccomend recording the final results of your projects. <br><br>

## Things I'd do differently next time
I would definitely label my x-axis with the time units so my final analysis is more coherent of each graph.
