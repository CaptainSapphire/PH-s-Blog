## 1.6: Polynomial functions and end behavior
### Polynomial functions
 To find the leading term of a polynomial, find the biggest degree.
```
3x^2 - 5x^5
```
The leading term is -5x^5, and the leading coefficient (number w/o variable attached) is -5. 

### End behavior
End behavior is the direction of the arrows at the end of the graph. you set it up as so:
```
## f(x) is replaced with whatever function you see in the graph, equation, etc
lim f(x) = 
x -> -∞
## ∞/-∞ is used depending on the side 
```
If you are referring to the left side, you will use -∞, and vice versa ∞ .

In terms of the actual answer, it will depend on the graph or the equation, and if it is even or odd.

If it's a graph, then it's incredibly simple. Look at the graph, if it's going up, the = is  ∞ . If it's pointing down, it's - ∞ .

If it's an even function, both the left and right will match. If it's odd, then the sides will be opposites. 
In the case it's odd, then if it's negative, the left side will be positive  ∞ , and vice versa.
