# CSUCI Datathon
This Saturday, I attended <a href="https://www.csuci.edu/news/releases/2025-first-ever-datathon.htm">CSUCI's first-ever Datathon</a>, an event to explore data science and its applications in real world business, healthcare, and research. <br><br>

I checked in and they handed me a tote bag of resources and swag. Then, I talked with the woman working behind the table. Her name was [Jasmine Wright](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jasmine-wright-0025271b4/), a senior at CSUCI majoring in Applied Mathmatics. She shared she was lookng into taking a gap year, and then getting her PhD. From there, she intended on working with marine biologists to study and research with them, in the field/as a data scientist. <br><br>

After that, I went inside the lecture hall and sat behind someone, and overheard them say they were going to Moorpark College. I jumped in since, I too, am going to Moorpark College in the fall as a freshman. I met Wylan Brown, an incoming chemistry major, as well as their brother, Andor Brown. <br><br>

After talking to Wylan about books and whatnot for a bit, the introductions presentation began, led by [Alona Kryshchenko](https://ciapps.csuci.edu/directory/Details?uid=alona.kryshchenko) and Isaac Noe Quintanilla-Salinas, Data Science and Mathmatics professors at CSUCI. <br><br>
Once we ran down what Data Science is, the schedule, and other items on the list, we went to the Computer Labs.
