# CSUCI Datathon
This Saturday, I attended <a href="https://www.csuci.edu/news/releases/2025-first-ever-datathon.htm">CSUCI's first-ever Datathon</a>, an event to explore data science and its applications in real world business, healthcare, and research. <br><br>

*the morning was so cold, but the campus is so pretty!* <br><Br>

I checked in and they handed me a tote bag of resources and swag. Then, I talked with the woman working behind the table. Her name was [Jasmine Wright](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jasmine-wright-0025271b4/), a senior at CSUCI majoring in Applied Mathmatics. She shared she was lookng into taking a gap year, and then getting her PhD. From there, she intended on working with marine biologists to study and research with them, in the field/as a data scientist. <br><br>

After that, I went inside the lecture hall and sat behind someone, and overheard them say they were going to Moorpark College. I jumped in since, I too, am going to Moorpark College in the fall as a freshman. I met Wylan Brown, an incoming chemistry major, as well as their brother, Andor Brown. <br><br>

Once we ran down what Data Science is, the schedule, and other items on the list, we went to the Computer Labs. 

## RStudio Lesson

There were some very helpful instructors walking around answering all our questions. At one point, they kept one instructor close to my station because I often asked for more detail, or about a potential error in the directions, or for clarification, haha. <br><br>
**Well Priya, what did you learn?** <br><br>
I'm glad you asked! A lot. Although I'd like to detail everything, I'll save that for [my YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@priya-harry) and tutorials I'll make later. <br><br>
However, once I finished, I made a summary of everything I had learned in R Studio with comments, so I'll insert some pictures of all of that here: <br><br>

*free food!* <br><br>
Lunch was free and provided. Wylan and I sat and ate together, and then we went to say hi to their brother. At their table was a couple, so I talked to them for a short while. Both of them used to go to art school, interestingly enough. Now, they are in much different careers, with one working in business and one working in data science. They both shared their individual experiences with such a career transition, and as well as what exactly they currently do. Check them out on Linkedin, [Lu (Lydia) Timlin-Broussard](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lydiambroussard/) and [Christopher Timlin-Broussard](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ctbrou/), they were both such a delight to meet. :) <br><br>
We talked with Andor shortly, before reconvening to the lecture hall to prepare for the competition.
