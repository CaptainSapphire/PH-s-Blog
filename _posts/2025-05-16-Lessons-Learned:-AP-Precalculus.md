# Lessons Learned: AP Precalculus
This year, I took AP Precalulus. Despite my inital impression, the class challenged me more than I would have ever imagined, and I finished with a C both semesters. Now that the year has ended, I'm left to wonder: What happened?

## The year
### The Summer Work
It all started with the mindset I had going into it. The summer work was all algebra two review. "Oh this is easy!" I said, as I didn't do much studying for the summer work quiz. The quiz had a lot of material that was not on the summer work packet. From that alone, I shouldn't have taken that as I one-off error. 

### The Year in a sentence or two
Each quiz and test, regardless of my study method, yielded the same results. 60%s, 70%s. The 80%s were purely due to the questions being easier, still scoring about 5-10% less or around the average. 

## Study Methods
I had a few I swapped between throughout the year. 
- Khan academy practice: algebra 2 and ap precalc
- myopenmath practice
- flipped math practice
- worksheet review (redoing problems that are wrong)
- youtube video lessons

## What happened?
There are a few reasons why I think this is the result/outcome. 

### Too late
I put a lot of effort in the last couple of week to prepare for the final, but I really should have put that much more into the content on a regular basis, until I understood the AP exam and course more than the teacher. 

### Look for the Flags
I should have noticed the red flags with the class and my understanding of the material much sooner and next time I will look for them. 

### Self Study
The two students that excelled in the class that I know stated that they self studied and taught themselves the material. I think if I run into roadbumps with the way the course is taught or if I'm struggling with the material based on my learning style, I should practice the same. 

## What did I learn?
I learned quite a few things, all woven into the "what happened section."

## Side notes
I should clarify now that grades are not a mark of intelligence or smartness. I know I am not stupid necessarily for getting a C in this class. <br><br>
On top of that, I want to state the mindset I have with this failure. It's okay to fail if I learn from it. 

## Plans for the Future
I am taking calculus in the fall, so I am going to do the Khan Academy course for it over sumemr so I can be well-prepared before I walk into the class. I'll self study and teach the material until I could teach a class myself, and I'll use the methods that worked most effectively (study with people who know more, study ahead of time and reguarly, use review videos and packets). 

## Thank you
I don't regret taking this class. Although it may sound like a downer to read, I would go through it all over again to understand even more and do my best to learn and become a better student. Thank you so much for sticking with me on this journey, and see you next time :)
