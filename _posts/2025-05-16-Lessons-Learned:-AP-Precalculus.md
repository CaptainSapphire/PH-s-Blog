# Lessons Learned: AP Precalculus
This year, I took AP Precalulus. Despite my inital impression, the class challenged me more than I would have ever imagined, and I finished with a C both semesters. Now that the year has ended, I'm left to wonder: What happened?

## The year
### The Summer Work
It all started with the mindset I had going into it. The summer work was all algebra two review. "Oh this is easy!" I said, as I didn't do much studying for the summer work quiz. The quiz had a lot of material that was not on the summer work packet. From that alone, I shouldn't have taken that as I one-off error. 

### The Year in a sentence or two
Each quiz and test, regardless of my study method, yielded the same results. 60%s, 70%s. The 80%s were purely due to the questions being easier, still scoring about 5-10% less or around the average. 

## Study Methods
I had a few I swapped between throughout the year. 
- Khan academy practice: algebra 2 and ap precalc
- myopenmath practice
- flipped math practice
- worksheet review (redoing problems that are wrong)
