# Second Computer Science Meeting
I am a Data Science student at Moorpark College, and a member of the Moorpark College Computer Science Club! yap more about creative hour later

## Creative Hour
Ethan (President of the CS Club: [his github](https://github.com/suborange)) presented a couple of projects:
- Winning Sequence: A project used by mapping digits to actions, and then trying to solve/play a game. It will run through the infinite sequence of pi and perform the action of the selected digit. He saw the project originally on twitch, where the program will play Pokemon Sapphire, and Ethan made it to try and solve a rubix cube. He made it in TypeScript (a subset of javascript). He mentioned using p5.js, which was cool to see since I used it back when I first started at Girls Who Code.
- Basics of API: Application Programming Interface, a URL that instead of returning a webpage, it returns raw data or text, so in a project, you can tell a project to retrieve the information from the API and use it. In the winning sequence project, it was pi digits.
- A project idea provided to Ethan by Ed Garcia, a professor. It uses selenium. He goes to the myvcccd schedule, scrapes the data (enrollment numbers, date, professor, etc), and organizes/formats it in a file that he has set up a [email subscription site](https://www.pems.email/) and they will be notified about the class. The data is updated daily, (computer opens selenium, formats data, updates site, sends email). He plans to set this up with the college itself (rather than just a personal project), and then the district too! He uses the company that made next.js 's product Versel(?). He got the domain himself.


## Final Thoughts
