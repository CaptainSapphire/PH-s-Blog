# Second Computer Science Meeting
I am a Data Science student at Moorpark College

## Creative Hour
Ethan (President of the CS Club) presented a few projects:
- Winning Sequence: A project used by mapping digits to actions, and then trying to solve/play a game. It will run through the infinite sequence of pi and perform the action of the selected digit. He saw the project originally on twitch, where the program will play Pokemon Sapphire, and Ethan made it to try and solve a rubix cube. He made it in TypeScript (a subset of javascript).
