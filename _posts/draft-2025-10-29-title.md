# GWC Panel #2: Inside Tech - Career Stories & Insights You Need to Know
context

## Meeting Notes
I missed the first few questions note wise*

Think back to your early career: What do you wish you had known when you were just starting out in your career? Is there anything you would have done differently?
- Soft skills, critical thinking, focus on technical career growth, networking

What advice would you give to someone hoping to break into the tech industry but who may feel uncertain about exactly what they want to do?
- Everyone is constantly growing and exploring their interests! But take the opportunity to find and discover what you find interesting 

“My contribution matters more than my gender”

How can I develop stronger communication skills, especially in expressing complex ideas clearly and confidently?

Start small and local! I have been humbled many times trying to explain what I do to my family who does not understand tech. The ability to explain complex ideas or speak confidently can start with any topic and does not have to be specific to your work. The skill is transferable

How can I approach communcating to my part-time work manager to take off to attend GHC, when we just had "not putting so much on your plate" conversation, "follow through your commitments" and he already told me, once you don't commit, it's gonna show up in your professional career. He seems to think that I am overextending myself, doing whatever that looks interesting.
