## Notes

**Key Pillars and Vision**
- Strategic Growth: The video emphasizes expanding PTK’s reach to more community college students, ensuring that high-achieving students from all backgrounds have access to the benefits of the honor society.
- Student Success and Completion: A primary goal is increasing completion rates. The vision for 2026 focuses on providing the tools, mentorship, and resources necessary for students to not only join but to graduate and transfer or enter the workforce successfully.
- Leadership Development: The organization aims to enhance its "Leadership Development Studies" curriculum, focusing on real-world application and empowering students to take on leadership roles within their chapters and communities.

**Focus Areas for 2026**
- Scholarship Access: Strengthening the PTK Scholarship platform to connect more students with millions of dollars in transfer and competitive scholarships.
- Career Readiness: A renewed focus on workforce students, ensuring that those pursuing vocational or technical degrees receive recognition and professional development tailored to their career paths.
- Diversity and Inclusion: Ensuring that the vision for 2026 includes intentional efforts to engage underrepresented student populations and create a more inclusive environment across all chapters.

**Call to Action for Chapters**
- Engagement: Encouraging local chapters to align their projects (such as Honors in Action and College Project) with these national goals.
- Visibility: Increasing the visibility of PTK on campus to ensure every eligible student understands the value of membership and the support system available to them.
