# Git Workshop
I am a member of Moorpark College's Computer Science Club, which hosted a Git Workshup this week. 

## Notes
Github is an online hosting service for software dev and version control using Git. 
- Free, open source
- collaboration efforts
- Git is distributed version control system software

Important because:
- collaboration in companies
- projectd can be recovered is computer is lost/crashes
- Github portfolio for job/internship applications

3 Methods:
- Github browser
- Desktop Applications (most used and preferred by presenter)
- Git Bash

Notes
- Do not use long file names in github, it will throw an error

Repository
- Project with name and files
- click New to make a new repository
- visibility: public/private
