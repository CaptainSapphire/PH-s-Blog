# The First competition: Moorpark!
Last Saturday, the Oak Park Eagle Brigade (OPB) went to our first competition: The Moorpark Competition. 

## A Breakdown
After I arrived at the school roughly 3 minutes before call time (12:15), I checked in with uniform managers. I put on my bibber [(lower half of a marching band uniform)](https://stanbury.com/products/ultra-bibbers-28-inseam-shorter-length) and checked if I could perform the dance break of movement 4 in the bibber. I was able to, though we used the strap on the inside of the hat to keep the hats on for this show. I checked in with my section to see if they had everything and then used what remaining time I had to talk with my friends. <br><br>
A little while later, Mr. Borquez (performing arts/band director) calls us to standing-by and we listen in. He double-checks with each section that they all have their instruments and equipment. The flutes are typically on top of it, so there was little concern coming from me. Plus, I already checked with them. He then dismisses the larger instruments to put their instruments in the compartment under the bus. I mingled with the flutes and clarinets before Mr. Borquez then dismissed us. I helped my friend carry his hat boxes to the bus and became the last senior to enter the bus. Fortunately, they still honored seniority, so it was fine. <br><br>
I sat across and with my friends. On the bus ride there, Mr. Borquez had us run through the show in our heads. Once the timer was up, we went back to chatting. <br><br>
Once we got on campus, pit unloaded their equipment. I spent more time with my friends before going and figuring out how I was to take my prop onto the field. <br><br>
I have a half-moon (filled in on the right side), and I put it on the 30-yard line, on the home hash. It's a very easy-to-spot dot. Mr. Borquez instructed us to not leave our props from then on. There are 12 props, and it was flutes, clarinets, and some of brass carrying them on. It would've been easier as a count to have the saxophones help, however, from a field standpoint, it is indeed better to have some members of brass assist.

## The Aftermath
We are part of the 2A Green division. We placed fourth among our division. However, among 17 schools in 2A overall, we still placed 4th.
