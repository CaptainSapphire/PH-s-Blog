## Fireside Chat - General Questions
- "You have to control what you can control, which is your skillset; your mindset, your behavior" (Tomesah Harrison)
- " We want to hear about the "So what?", the journey", essentially stating a "show not tell" model of application; "how did I take this one simple thing as an action and sew it all the way through?" (Tomesah Harrison)
-  "We still have to focus and cultivate our human essential skills, our communication" (Tomesah Harrison)

### Dr. Tarika Barrett
The next step:
- Connecting with the community, connect with peopel that help us with our narrative and our work, "being supported by a communty can help build your confidence..."
- Look to join professional organization and connect/network with professionals, reach out and "just ask and schedule a coffee chat"
- Take advantage of the free resources out there! (IBM SkillsBuild for one option :) )

## Fireside Chat - Audience Questions

For introverts like myself, what should be the first step/approach I should take in networking?

==> We need to do things that scare us sometimes! 'It takes effort. I become very intention with how I network so I don't overwhelm myself... Do the things that make us uncomfortable, they stretch us and make us grow... Quality and not Quantity" (Tomesah Harrison)

## QnA
Question: I struggle scheduling coffee chats because I feel like im not sure what to speak about, or what If it ends up being awkward. What is your approach to a good coffee chat, or  how has a student had a successful coffee chat with you?

Allie Ogino (she/her):
This is a great question! Here is a framework we at GWC recommend. 
1. Review their profile on LinkedIn.
2. Refine your elevator pitch/career goals.
3. Prepare 2-3 questions for the conversation.
4. Ask for recommendations of groups, resources, or other people to connect with.
5. Send a thank you and connect with them on LinkedIn. Hopefully this helps you get started!

Does resume length matter at this point of our early careers. Will it help an applicant stand out if you might have more bullet points or have two pages if it is relevant info?

Allie Ogino (she/her):
Great question, Ellen! It generally makes a difference what you are applying for. Sometimes a 1-pager is good and sometimes a more fleshed out CV is best. The most important thing is that your bullet points correspond to the job description. We have resume review during Upskill - hope you will submit your resume and recruiters can review it for you an offer feedback
