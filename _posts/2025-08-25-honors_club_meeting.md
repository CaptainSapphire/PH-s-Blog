# First Honors Club Meeting
## Context
Hello everyone! If you're new, welcome to my blog! I am a moorpark college student majoring in data science, who is aiming to transfer. The honors program helps with the transfer process, and I am a member. By extension, I joined the honors club, which provides advisement and resources for honors students. On August 25th, 2025, I attended the first honors club meeting via zoom. <br><br>

This meeting's focus is to talk about MC2UCLA.

- often used for feedback on applications (while not official, went through process themselves.)
- general questions

Guide to UC Application:
- August: application open
- October 1st: application submittable
- November 30: Application deadline
Tips: (not all of  them, but ones that I took note to)
1. TAG application goes to one campus
2. Assist.org to confirm major prep courses
3. Plan courses stragetically (IGETC, TAG, TAP)
4. apply broadly to multiple UCs
5. GPA trends (upward trajectory = strong)
6. PIQ: choose prompts that show growth, resilience, impact
7. Don't repeat information
8. Be specific to your role, actions, and results
9. Clear, authentic voice (no fluff)
10. Draft early and get feedback
11. extracurriculars: community, tie activites back to major and what you gave/recieved from the activites
12. common mistakes: missing required coures, word limit on PIQs, don't overgeneralize and instead showcase unique experiences
