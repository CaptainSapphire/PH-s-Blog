Guide to UC Application:

Tips: (not all of  them, but ones that I took note to)
1. TAG application goes to one campus
2. Assist.org to confirm major prep courses
3. Plan courses stragetically (IGETC, TAG, TAP)
4. apply broadly to multiple UCs
5. GPA trends (upward trajectory = strong)
6. PIQ: choose prompts that show growth, resilience, impact
7. Don't repeat information
8. Be specific to your role, actions, and results
9. Clear, authentic voice (no fluff)
10. Draft early and get feedback
11. extracurriculars: community, tie activites back to major and what you gave/recieved from the activites
12. common mistakes: missing required coures, word limit on PIQs, don't overgeneralize and instead showcase unique experiences


Thank you to the presentor Alette Laughton, a MC2UCLA mentor. It was incredibly informative and I look forward to this year!
