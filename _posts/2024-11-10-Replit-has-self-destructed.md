# Replit has self-destructed. 
To watch so much potential wither away is... disappointing, and disheartening. What happened?

## The start of the story
Amjad Masad, a seven year old, had a love for for programming. Despite facing a range of academic odds, Masad graudated from high school and majored in Computer Science at PSUT. 
After working at Yahoo and [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/about), Masad moved to starting up a platform of his own. Hence, Replit was born. 
<br><br>
Last year, I took AP Computer Science Principles, and Replit was mixed in the course. We were taught, for a year, that Replit was an IDE to build and test your code. If you search "What is Replit" on DuckDuckGo, 
it is defined as an IDE - or as they put it, " an American start-up and an online integrated development environment." In fact, there are hundreds of videos on YouTube calling Replit an IDE. 
<br><br> 
This is where the problem starts. In 2020, far before all of these occurences, Masad stated that [Replit is not an IDE](https://amasad.me/replit_ide). It just was an IDE for everyone. And so, hundreds of Repls manifested on the platform. Their Python course, 100s days of Python, requires making a new Repl each time. <br><br>
**They then instill a limit, 3 repls. Now, you've gotta pay for more. And, your old Repls will be deleted.**<br><br>
I don't disagree with the policy of removing old, unused Repls. If they don't serve a purpose, it is a waste of resources. The incredibly low Repl limit introduces their subscription service. No activity on their twitter can be found discussing this. In fact, Replit seems to have done more to make the subject be radio silent. <br><br>

## Radio Silence
[Replit's Twitter](https://x.com/Replit) has only covered their Replit AI features and Replit Agent. The loss of this free resource for code is gone, essentially. It was a competitor to Microsoft and GitHub, and it seems GitHub will still be the coding capital as it stands. I'm posting this through Github, and I am grateful for the resources it provides for free. However, it is still unfortunate to see such a competitor with so much potential wither away.

There are so many flaws in how this is covered.
