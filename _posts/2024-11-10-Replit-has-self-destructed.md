# Replit has self-destructed. 
To watch so much potential wither away is... disappointing, and disheartening. What happened?

## The start of the story
Amjad Masad, a seven year old, had a love for for programming. Despite facing a range of academic odds, Masad graudated from high school and majored in Computer Science at PSUT. 
After working at Yahoo and [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/about), Masad moved to starting up a platform of his own. Hence, Replit was born. 
<br><br>
Last year, I took AP Computer Science Principles, and Replit was mixed in the course. We were taught, for a year, that Replit was an IDE to build and test your code. If you search "What is Replit" on DuckDuckGo, 
it is defined as an IDE - or as they put it, " an American start-up and an online integrated development environment." In fact, there are hundreds of videos on YouTube calling Replit an IDE. 
<br><br> 
This is where the problem starts. In 2020, far before all of these occurences, Masad stated that [Replit is not an IDE](https://amasad.me/replit_ide). It just was an IDE for everyone. And so, hundreds of Repls manifested on the platform. Their Python course, 100s days of Python, requires making a new Repl each time. <br><br>
They then instill a limit, 3 repls. Now, you've gotta pay for more. And, your old Repls will be deleted.
