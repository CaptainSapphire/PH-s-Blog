# Transfer Day at Moorpark College

## In case you're new...
I am a student at Moorpark College majoring in data science, aiming to transfer to a UC in 2 years, more specifically, UCLA. On Thursda, August 28, 2025, Moorpark College hosted their [transfer fair](https://www.instagram.com/moorparkcollege/p/DND4AwAKvZx/). A large amount of colleges visited, setting up their stands at their respective tables and providing insight to anyone who stops by. [(Here's the information website linked in the instagram post.)](https://www.moorparkcollege.edu/departments/student-services/university-transfer-center) <br><br>

## The Transfer Fair
Whenever I would approach a table, my first question (besides "How are you?") is "Do you have data science?" I got 3 types of answers. 
1. "No, sorry." Pretty self-explanatory. Usually from there they promote cybersecurity and computer science as a major. This was mostly the private colleges.
2. "We have data analytics?" Data analytics is not a bad option by any means, although I do not think it is what I am looking for, at least at the moment.
3. "We do! It is actually new this year, and highly selective!" Those three always seem to come in combination, but it makes sense. This field is growing rapidly, so it does not come as a shock that it is highly selective. <br>

I found that interesting, so I figured I'd include it. Here are some of the college interactions I recall or have the brochures for. <br><br>

**The Colleges:**
- UCLA!
- Cal Poly Humboldt: The first stand I got to interact with, and despite the distance, a really solid option. On campus housing is guarenteed,
- UC Irvine: They have a pretty solid data science program, and I'm not too far out from it, either. Definitely a solid option.
- UC Berkeley: Found out they are researched based, and I would be able to explore the business, healthcare, or AI side while there, which is nice.
- USC: They have an econ & data science major which focuses on the business side of data science, and the outreach person did not really reccomend it... On top of the tuiton, it seems unlikely I will end up at USC.
- UC San Diego: Gave me a really helpful guide and advice on how to get accepted when I apply! Mostly, it was class related, because the outreach person stated that assist.org may not have all the classes on the agreement and to check a given website. 
- UC Davis
- University of San Francisco, Cal Lutheran University, DePaul University, CSULB, Loyola Marymount University, UCSB, UC Merced

Ones I'm not considering but still pleasant to talk with and learn about:
- South New Hampshire University, CSU San Marcos, CSUCI, Whittier College, Chapman University, University of Phoenix, Sonoma State University, Pepperdine University, WGU, Grand Canyon University, Northern Arizona University, Iowa State University, Woodbury University
<br><br>
There were many more visiting, but most of the ones I didn't hit were art universities. <br><br>
There was a throughline of the schools reccomending I partake in Phi Theta Kappa, so I'll be sure to check that out and make a post about it if I get into it.

**The experience:** <br><br>
Beyond the friendly college outreach people, the music major students were putting on a performance (my favorite was ther rendition of "Creep") in the background and they had a desert place do catering, so I got to try a peach handpie. <br><br>

## Final Thoughts
I really enjoyed attending this event and learning so much about some of my transfer options, and I cannot wait to apply for transfer during next fall, 2026. Thank you for reading, and be sure to follow for more :)
