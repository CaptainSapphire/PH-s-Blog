# My plan for APPC
APPC = Advanced Placement(AP) Pre-Calculus
## Context
I am currently in APPC at my high school. Recently, I took the Unit 1B test. The average score of my friends and I collectively is 65-70%. 
Beyond my personal beliefs that the average should be a B, and this falls on the instruction, something still needs to be done about it.  

## Why do I need this class at all??
This class has been called "useless" across the internet. The first result for "AP Precalculus course" on YouTube is a video explaining why APPC is dumb. 
I do not know the logistics, but in order to start at Moorpark College with Calculus, I need to take a course demonstrating my understanding of the math that comes before. 

## The plan
After seeing the grade, I immediately opened a Google Doc. Every resource I knew for math help, I checked. 
- First, I hunted down the *Math Honors Society (MHS)* poster and planned times each day to go in and review the homework with them. 
- I checked SchoolHouse.org to see if they have Precalculus help. Unfortunately, my search was unfruitful. There aren't any times that I can join.
- I checked Khan Academy and found they have a clear Precalculus review.
