# What I've learned in APPC so far

"If you know how to explain something, you truly understand it," to quote my dad, each time I discuss with him before a test. "Scientists
have found that if you explain things (aloud), you remember them better," to quote my English teacher. <br><br>

With that, here are the major topics I've learned in APPC from week #1 and week #2. 

## Concavity
Concavity is the curve of a graph. The best way to think of it is a parabola that grows more quadratic/exponential.

There is a simple way to tell the concavity of the graph, which is by drawing a little smiley face. If it's smiling, it's up! If it's sad, it's down :( 

## Increasing vs. Decreasing
This one can be confusing but consider it a separate thing to concavity. Like, the concavity is the ice cream, and increasing/decreasing is the cone/cup.

When the slope (or the rate the line is changing) is positive, it's going up, then it's increasing, and vice versa. 

## Finding the rate of change

```
f(x)-f(x) // x -- x
```
This is the formula. It's a long process, stay with me. <br><br>
1. You'll get your two x values, and you will plug it in to your given equation. The *x* values will be formatted like an x,y but with [] brackets. [5,6]
2. You'll get your two y values. (5, 3) (6, 7).
3. You'll plug these values into the formula.
```
7-3 // 6-5
```
4. You'll simplify and get your rate of change.
```
4 // 1 = 4/1 = 4
```
And yeah! With this formula, you can alos backtrack if you don't get the numbers I listed, I just listed the traditional equation.
