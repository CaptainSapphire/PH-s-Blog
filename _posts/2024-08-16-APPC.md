# What I've learned in APPC so far

"If you know how to explain something, you truly understand it," to quote my dad, each time I discuss with him before a test. "Scientists
have found that if you explain things (aloud), you remember them better," to quote my English teacher. <br><br>

With that, here are the major topics I've learned in APPC from week #1 and week #2. 

## Concavity
Concavity is the curve of a graph. The best way to think of it is a parabola that grows in a more quadratic/exponential manner.

There is a simple way to tell the concavity of the graph, which is by drawing a little smiley face. If it's smiling, it's up! If it's sad, it's down :(.
