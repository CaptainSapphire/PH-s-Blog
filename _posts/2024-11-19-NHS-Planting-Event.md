# NHS Planting Event 2024

## Details
National Honors Society (NHS) is a program at schools across the nation to encourage leadership and community amongst students. 
To be a member, you must:
- maintain a 3.5 GPA
- Attend 3 service events a semester<br><br>
I had one service event left, so I signed up. It was held on Monday, November 11th, 11:30 a.m. - 2:30 p.m.
on the OPHS Back entry/exit ramp next to the football and baseball field. It involved "planting trees and other physical activities," according to the email.

## The event
I arrived early to the school and spent some time getting homework done. I walked down to the ramp and got there right at 11:30 a.m. The hill down at the field
was composed of dead grass prior to the event. As I arrived, it turns out students from other high schools showed up and did the majority of the planting. So, I was put on the mulching crew.
After about five minutes, planting was completed and everyone was on mulching. <br><br>
The president made a mistake in sign-ups, so we also had double the amount of people as expected to complete the event. 
I introduced myself to one of the staff members who was explaining what to do. We exchanged names and he seemed to take a liking to me. 
Mulching involved first putting mulch from the big pile into a container, and then distributing the mulch around the hill without covering the plants themselves.
