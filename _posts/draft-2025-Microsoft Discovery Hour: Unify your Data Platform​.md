# Microsoft Discovery Hour: Unify your Data Platform​
I am a Data Science student at Moorpark College, and I have a lot to learn about the data science industry. So, I attended the "Microsoft Discovery Hour: Unify your Data Platform​" Webinar to learn about the tools offered and how they can be applied in real-world situations. <br><Br>

## Notes
Most organizations today work in disconnected environments, not fully utilizing the tools, leading to multiple copies of the same data. 
1. limited interoperability (It's harder to move around, slowing down operations)
2. Data Exposure risks
3. Vendor Sprawl <br>
solution = unify your data into one ecosystem, simplifying complexity and increasing efficiency.
<br><br>

How to do that with Microsoft Analytic Solutions:
"It's not just about being a modern data platform. It's about making sure that platform is ready to support the kinds of innovation your business is driving forward."
4 key outcomes: <br><br> 
- Unify your data estate = reduced vendor sprawl, collecting data into one place
- transform data for powerful AI solutions = having systems that can support vedor search, natural language queries and real-time access.
- empower everyone with analytics and insights = creates a data driven culture by giving the whole company access to analytics
- seamlessly govern and protect your data

Transform data for powerful AI solutions
"It's not just about making data usable, it's about turning it into a strategic advantage." 
- A large qunatity of leders say they want to invest in AI, but of the 93% that say data strategy is key to using generative AI efficiently, 57& haven't made the shift --> ambition v. execution

Empower everyone with analytics and insights
"Organizations are investing in data tools, but many still struggle to unlock their full value across teams."
- all users, regardless of specialization should have access 
- AI-powered analytics in Microsoft tools exist that use natural language
<br><br>

Seamlessly Govern and protect your data
"These gaps expose more than just security vulnerabilities. They also stall innovation, limit data access, and erode trust across teams."
- Need to protect data without slowing innovation --> embed governance/security into data estate

BMW's experience
- BMW collects a lot of data and uses mobile apps to manange their data
- Github/Github actions is used to manage data
- Azure Carbonator Services for cloud work
- Hoping to implement Copilot into the user experience

Other Partner Examples:
- Toyota, automotive
- Bayer, Healthcare
- Air India, Travel
The finish line: Microsoft Fabric and Azure Databricks

Azure Accelerate 
- for cloud transformation
- set of resources for advisement and financial management 

Thank you to and amazing work from the presenter [Palak Sharma](https://www.linkedin.com/in/palakshr/) (go-to-market lead for Data Platforms for the Americas at Microsoft).

## Final Thoughts
While I may be new to the data science field and industry, it was a wonderful opportunity from Microsoft to learn about their tools and the impact they aim to have with them.
