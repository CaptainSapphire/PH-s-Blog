# Can ChatGPT make a website with React?
<br>

Starting a new website can be scary, especially using a tool you aren't familiar with. Today, I asked myself, **"What if I could do it with the newest change to the technological industry: AI/ChatGPT?"**

I started by asking GPT where in the browser I could build this. This way, readers of this blog and viewers of my YouTube can participate in this with me as well! 
GPT reccomended I use the IDE *CodeSandBox*.

All I had to do was *login with Github* and make a new sandbox,
