# Music at the Movies Day 2: How was it?

## Context
I am in the Oak Park High School's Wind Ensemble, and we had a concert 2 weeks ago called *Music at the Movies.* 
Music at the Movies is a different type of concert the OPM Program puts on. The following differences sets it apart from other concerts:
- It is the only one where entry is charged. 20$ for adults, 5$ for students (with school ID).
- Only tunes from Movies/Media are played.
- A screen behind the performers playing video from said media.
- Headphones used to keep time with the onscreen video.

## A Review

### Emcees
Both emcees were emceeing for the first time, but I thought they did wonderful. Oliver is in Comedy Sportz, so he's used to improv, and Kamila is a natural (and their energies bounce off each other.) Honestly, I watched back the livestream partially to appreciate their efforts as emcees, since they did so great.
