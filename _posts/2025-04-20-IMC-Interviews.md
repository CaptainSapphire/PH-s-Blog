# IMC Interviews
I am the president of the student body of the performing arts department at Oak Park High School. This provided me the opportunity to sit it on the interviews for the next year board with Ms. McClamma and Mr. Borquez, directors/teachers of the performing arts department. 


## Notes from During the Interview
Questions we asked:
-why are you going for this role?
- what do you like 
- what could be improved
- time commitment
- how did your current roles go for you
- for later joiners, how come you delayed joining?


What should be improved?
- training x2
- PR x2
- communications x4
- more zoom meetings on top of in person meetings?
- more communications to strings about concert report; maybe make a form
-providing more resources for learning or opportunities x2 
- recruitment x2 - middle schoolers and stuff
- bring back leads? x3
- concert report mindset should be more positive 
- attendance for imc meetings?


interviewees tend to:
- talk to fast (excited)
- refrain to articulate words (Isaiah)
- good posture :)
- varying levels of dressing for the interview
- knowing when to stop and end a story

good!
- sharing ideas for improvement
- showing a love for the program

## Final Thoughts
This was interesting to see, and I never really expected to be on the other side of the table. Thank you for reading!
