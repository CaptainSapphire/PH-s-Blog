# The Career Chats Website Journey

# Context
The high school I attend, Oak Park High School, has a College and Career Center. Once a month, the College and Career Center hosts Career Chats. 
This is where the Center hosts professionals to speak on their subject, from computer animators to FBI agents. 
However, they have students manage these. <br><br>

# Before Today
Prior to my attendance at Oak Park High School, Arushi Mathur & Sadhika Adicherla ran the Career Chats. 
They had made [a website for Career Chats](https://career-chats.webnode.page/). I have been told the speaker's events ran smoothly under their combined efforts. Once they graduated, Joely Chadwick took over and has managed since.  

# My end
At the beginning of the year, I saw the College and Career Center was offering a volunteer opportunity to help with the Career Chats. Two other girls and I joined to help, though it remained uneventful until recently. <br><br>

I contacted Arushi Mathur about the old website and its login, but she did not have it/could not find it. She was quite helpful in sharing the other old resources, but it seemed we had to make a website. I debated between making it in html/css or react, or learning something new with it. <br><br>
However, this website needs to be *easy to edit* for future volunteers, and OPHS students are pretty familiar with Google Sites. So, I rebuilt the old website with some modifications to Google Sites in about 30 minutes.
