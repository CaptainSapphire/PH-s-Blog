# DTCC Escape room

## Context

## How it works
- tell volunteer what to click
- computer science based problems

## Notes
First we got an intro to some comp. sci. basics:
- ASCII (binary, decimal, hexadecimal)
- varaibles, while loops, if conditionals
- arithmetic operators (==, !=, --, +-, %)
<br><br>

We then went into breakout rooms. <br><br>
- oval office escape room theme
- first puzzle was based on the fibonacci sequence
- second puzzle was based on binary
- third puzzle was if conditionals
<br><br>

We finished the puzzle pretty fast as a team. After that, the GWC students asked the DTCC volunteers some questions. 
- "Favorite part of your job?": Working from home, working on projects, solving puzzles
- some of the volunteers got in via an internship
- "Exploration Development Growth" Program, for when you get out of college
- a lot of promotion toward the internships, both are paid and solid opportunities
<br><br>

Thank you to these volunteers from my breakout room:
- Stephanie Clopeck & Lecia Cook - Had a lot of good advice on career paths, and internships!
- Akiko Green - (from GWC, not DTCC) But incredibly supportive
-  John Wu & David Camara - Ran the puzzle and kept up positive energy through the event
Thank you Elisa Rexinger for running the main room and checking in on all the breakout rooms, and being very helpful with education and career based advice!
