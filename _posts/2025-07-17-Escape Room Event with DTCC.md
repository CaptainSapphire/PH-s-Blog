# DTCC Escape room

## Context

## How it works
- tell volunteer what to click
- computer science based problems

## Notes
First we got an intro to some comp. sci. basics:
- ASCII (binary, decimal, hexadecimal)
- varaibles, while loops, if conditionals
- arithmetic operators (==, !=, --, +-, %)

We then went into breakout rooms.
- oval office escape room theme
- first puzzle was based on the fibonacci sequence
- second puzzle was based on binary
- third puzzle was if conditionals


We finished the puzzle pretty fast as a team. After that, the GWC students asked the DTCC volunteers some questions. 
- "Favorite part of your job?": Working from home, working on projects, solving puzzles
- some of the volunteers got in via an internship
- "Exploration Development Growth" Program, for when you get out of college
- a lot of promotion toward the internships, both are paid and solid opportunities

Thank you to these volunteers from my breakout room:
- Stephanie Clopeck & Lecia Cook - Had a lot of good advice on career paths, and internships!
- Akiko Green - (from GWC, not DTCC) But incredibly supportive
-  John Wu & David Camara - Ran the puzzle and kept up positive energy through the event
