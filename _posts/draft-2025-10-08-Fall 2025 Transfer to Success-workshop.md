# CCTS: Fall 2025 Transfer to Success
I am a Moorpark College student majoring in data science, aiming to transfer to a UC, so, I am currently a participant is UC Berkley's Community College Transfer Services (CCTS) webinar series, which is all about preparing for the application and your future. This webinar (on 10/07/2025) was focused on the major requirements and general techniques for transfer success. <br><br>

## Meeting Notes
(Land Acknowledgement to xucyun people, CCTS certification requirements, virtual community expectations)

**UC Minimum Eligibility (general)** <br><br>
GPA: 2.4-3.0 GPA for UC transferable courses <br>
- UCLA/UCSD, UCB - 3.0 GPA minimum
- UCB College of Engineering - 3.5 GPA minimum
Units <br>
- 60 semester/90 quarter units
- no more than 14 semester can be pass/no pass
Other: <br>
- Complete all required major prep courses with a C or better
- General ed, complete all general ed courses by your final spring semester

Strengthen your application:
- Strong UC GPA, especially in major prep courses
- fully complete major prep courses
- strong, reflective, personal insight questions

**UC General Education**
1. 7-course Pattern<br>
Minimum requirement of GE courses to be eligible for UC transfer, does not satisfy ALL lower division requirements

2. IGETC/CAL-GETC <br>
Satifies most of the UC lower division GE requirements. IGETC was the old name for it. Not every major/college accepts CalGETC, such as UCB's College of Engineering. AP Exams can fufill some of the requirements. 

4. Campus specific education <br>
Uncommon and generally just unique majors/specific cases ex: Liberal arts

<br><br>
**Assist.org**
- Rules for each major, check by campus
- has all major prep classes listed here
- Major and Year, confirm the colleges listed are correct
- Competitve major?
- Series Rule
- Required courses vs. Reccomended courses
- General Education Rules
<br><br>
*Once you're passed the "wall of text," there's the major agreement:*
- Split series (take both parts at the same community college), like a class and the lab of the class, or the A or B of a class series
- Complete A, B AND C? <-- take note of that
- Strongly reccomended courses = strengthens application
- No course articulated = do some research. In the required section = you have to take it at another college, otherwise it's alright
