# Preparations for Club week: VGC 2024
VGC is now in it's second year of running, and there were many preparations leading up to this week, club week, we had to cover.

## Forms!
We needed to fill out the club packet, and get signatures from the main leadership team + advisor. This year our advisor changed so we may use computers to program instead of laptops. 
We thanked last year's advisor, and got the signature we needed from this year's. After fufilling the online forms, the physical ones I ran to the ASB room to turn in after Wind Ensemble. 

## Video Annoucements
After writing a quick script, I gathered our most active members into the band room to record a video for the announcements. For some context, they show video announcements twice a semester, and the entire school sees it.
