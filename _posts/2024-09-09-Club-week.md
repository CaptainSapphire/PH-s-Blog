# Preparations for Club Week: VGC 2024
VGC is now in its second year of running, and there were many preparations leading up to this week, club week, we had to cover.

## Forms
We needed to fill out the [club packet](https://www.oakparkasb.com/_files/ugd/54204b_524d58ac06dd4a37b03f1805483b388f.pdf) and get signatures from the main leadership team + advisor. This year our advisor changed so we may use computers to program instead of laptops. 
We thanked last year's advisor and got the signature we needed from this year's. After fulfilling the online forms, the physical ones I ran to the ASB room to turn in after Wind Ensemble. 

## Video Annoucements
After writing a quick script, I gathered our most active members into the band room to record a video for the announcements. For some context, they show video announcements twice a semester, and the entire school sees them.

We had to do a couple of takes, but overall it turned out presentable. 

## Posterboard + Sign-Ups
Every club is required to have a posterboard, so over the weekend I updated ours and cleaned it up. This morning, I set up in OPHS's Pavilion. In class, I printed a physical sign-up sheet and cleared the responses on the online one. 

## Final Thoughts
I'm excited for club week, and if I get time I'll update you all about how it goes. Thank you for reading :)
