# New Student Welcome at Moorpark College
I will be a first-year student at Moorpark College, starting class on Monday. Yesterday was the New Student Welcome, or what is essentially orientation. 

## The Morning
After dropping my brother off at school, I arrived at Moorpark College at 8:30am. Check in began at 9am, so I got my math textbook from the library in that extra time. Keeping an eye on the school email is something vital for success it seems, as I was one of the few who, because I kept an eye on what textbooks would be annouced, did not have to pay for my calculus textbook. <br><br>

I went to check in and encountered a couple familiar faces from high school. Some interactions were more postive than others. Honestly, I would like to leave high school all the way behind, but I still its hand on my arm as I see all these people. I counted every face I recognized as people poured into the gym, having gone into the double digits by the end. The awkward hellos and heys I hope to see fade away. <br><br>
When I entered the gymnasium, I sat with another girl and talked with her for an hour; from 9am to 10am, until the event started. She was a film major, interestingly enough. I have met many art majors already, I am not sure why I am so drawn to creators. **I suppose the people who make things tend to be much more interesting than those who don't.** <br><br>
The president of Moorpark College came and hyped everyone up, and provided an introduction and warm welcome to Moorpark College. While I had not seen him before, I can understand with what little time that I did why he is president. There is something about how he provided his speech that emits confidence and a type of love for education and this college. <br><br>

Additionally, the ASMC (class/student council/student body) president gave a welcome, which was a nice way to start the morning. After that, we were split up and sent to our AOI Sessions.

## AOI Session
The AOI(Area of Interest) Sessions were sessions that ran from 10:45am-12:00pm based on what major we have annouced. While I am a studying Data Science Major, at Moorpark College, I am technically a "Computer Science Major," So I was sent to the "Business, Information, and Technology" Session. <br><br>
