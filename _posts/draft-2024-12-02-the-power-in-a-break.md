# The Power of Taking a Break
The average human being has to work, in one way or another. As I grow older, I witness this work becoming something more 
for my peers, my friends, and my family. Let's discuss the power of taking a break.  <br><br>
As simple as it may initially appear, breaks are vital to achieving ultimate productivity.

## One: You're worse short & long term, physically
By overworking yourself, in the short term, you are exhausted and the task dries out faster. Imagine going to a marching band competition for 12+ hours. I went to two of those this semester, and it would have been horrible for my mental and physical health had I not had a lunch/dinner/regular break. "Treat your body like a temple," as I have heard. If you constantly have activity(work without breaks) then it will break down.<br><br>
Picture smoking for just a minute every day for a year. Obviously, your lungs will be charred, and in the long term, it builds up. Overworking yourself does the same thing- your body at the end of it all will be exhausted, and you'll come to a halt in terms of productivity and even regular life activities.

## Two: You're worse short & long term, mentally
