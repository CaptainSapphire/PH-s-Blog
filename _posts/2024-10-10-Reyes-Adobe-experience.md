# How did Volunteering at Reyes Adobe go?

## Context
The Reyes Adobe Celebration is hosted each year and happens over the weekend.
My brother, in Boy Scouts, marched in the Saturday parade. 
On the second day, I was there to earn my volunteering credit for NHS.

## A Breakdown
### the Drive
My call time was 10:30 am. I spent my morning preparing my bag and getting ready. I wore some comfortable clothes, leggings and an oversized t-shirt with a cap.
