# How did Volunteering at Reyes Adobe go?

## Context
The Reyes Adobe Celebration is hosted each year and happens over the weekend.
My brother, in Boy Scouts, marched in the Saturday parade. 
On the second day, I was there to earn my volunteering credit for NHS.

## A Breakdown
### The Drive
My call time was 10:30 am. I spent my morning preparing my bag and getting ready. I wore some comfortable clothes, leggings and an oversized T-shirt with a cap. Google Maps directed me to the entrance, which was blocked off as the road was used for the event. I rerouted when through the residential area, and parked a little bit away from the event. I jogged down from the neighborhood to the event. I wrote the street down in my family's group chat to ensure I knew the location of my car.
