# CLARK - My Review

## Some Context
I am the T.A. (Teacher's Assistant) for AP Computer Science Principles. The teacher asked me to review the links for 
[this](https://clark.center/details/ncyte_center/44f7c9ba-a5ae-494f-8281-cd28d527809c) website. He stated he wanted a "student's perspective" as to what is educational and useful.
The next class period, I sat down and reviewed each of them. 

## The Review

(I censored my greeting to the teacher to keep his name private in this post, but I did indeed follow email etiquette.)<br><br>
I follow up with this review of the links. 
- 7/19 links were unusable. Either the school blocked them or the links didn't go anywhere.
- 8/19 links could have been used for an assignment and weren't entirely useless.
- 4/19 links were old and I did not recommend using them.
<br><br> 
Statistically speaking, that isn't the worst. Almost half of the links had potential. Not the worst outcome, though the information that would be new to the students (for the cybersecurity class, I think?) would be minimal. I went in the following class period, and the teacher checked his email. He said "Priya! I got your email. So this whole thing is useless, eh?"<br><br>
"Well, some things could perhaps provide value-"<br><br>
"It seems generally this won't be as good as I thought. Thank you, I appreciate it."<br><br>
He laughed it off and life continued as normal from there. I aided students with their App Lab projects (the AP project drafts) and I did my homework. 
## The Conclusion 
This wasn't anything new in terms of assignments, but was an interesting subject to explore nonetheless. I'm glad to have done my job as a T.A. and I look forward to any other ways I may assist him in the future.
