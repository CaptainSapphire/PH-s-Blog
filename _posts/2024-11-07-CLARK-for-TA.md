# CLARK - My Review

## Some Context
I am the T.A. (Teacher's Assistant) for AP Computer Science Principles. The teacher asked me to review the links for 
[this](https://clark.center/details/ncyte_center/44f7c9ba-a5ae-494f-8281-cd28d527809c) website. He stated he wanted a "student's perspective" as to what is educational and useful.
The next class period, I sat down and reviewed each of them.
