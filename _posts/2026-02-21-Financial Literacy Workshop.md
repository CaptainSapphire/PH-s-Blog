## Notes
General:
- Not For Profit --> lowest rate for a loan
<br><br>

**Good Vs. Bad Debt:**
- There are many different types of debt; some can be beneficial, while others can hurt you if you don't manage them wisely. All debt carries some level of risk, and each as its advantages and disadvantages.
- Good debt: student, home, car, consumer CAN be (depends on situation)
- Bad debt: credit card, payday
	- Credit card debt can build quickly and fast
	- Homes will accure value, equity
	- Student debt is investing in yourself
	- payday loans: emergency loans, not large & easy to get, high rate
	-350-500% !!!!

Paycheck to paycheck --> the interest rate will keep the loan high and growing at a rate the person will be unable to keep up with. 


**Strategies To Build Credit:**
- Open a line of credit
- Request that your payment history be reported
- open a joint account (optional)
- Pay all your bills on time and in full. Never miss a payment!

**When making loan decisions, Borrowers can look for:**
- Early payment penalties
- Annual fees
- ease of payment
- when a credit check will be done
- repayment terms
- annual percentage rates (APR)


**What is a credit Report**
- Your credit report is a snapshot of a credit profile, including your credit history
- Credit reports help lendrs, such as financial institutions, understand how creditworthy you are-- that is, whether you're likely to repay a loan if given onne.
- The 3 credit bureaus: Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion

**Accessing your credit report and score:**
- You can get one free credit report per year from annual credit report
- www.annualcreditreport.com
- You can also get a free credit report in case of reported fraud, if you need to apply for welfare, or if you are denied a loan or credit application. 


**Reading Your Credit Report**
- Public Records: lawsuits, bankruptcies, judgements, delinquent, or unpaid taxes
- Personal Information: Name, birthdate, SSN, address, name of spouse/employer
- Credit Accounts: Debt status, open/closed accounts
- Credit Inquiries: Organizations(...)


**Strategies to Optimize Credit**

Why scores go down: late payments!!, collections, bankruptcies, high debt compared to income, too many credit inquiries within the past year, charge-offs/sever delinquency (when the lender doesn't receive payment after several months and the lender has to take a loss), using most of your available credit or maxing out your cards

Improving your credit: Use less than 30% of your available credit, do not max out your credit cards, pay your bills on time (and in full, if possible), do not take on too much debt, create a follow a monthly budget, review and understand your credit report for accuracy (make written inquiries on items you believe are incorrect), get credit counseling, consider financial products



Other notes:
- Gross is before taxes and net is after taxes
