# Proper Email Etiquette

Email etiquette can be a hassle at times and nerve-wracking at others. My English teacher reviewed email etiquette as a review in class, and I figured it would be a good post to share, 
either as a necessary resource, or a helpful reminder.

# 1: The right subject line
It should be clear, short, concise, relevant, and professional. If a subject line doesn't read correctly, many professors and teachers won't click on the email at all.
Putting "grades" instead of "Grades of xx assignment" can make all the difference. It should be professional so you demonstrate respect for your teachers or directors as well.
If it's too long, it's running on. Most people only give an email a quick glance before deciding if it's worth the time or the read. 

# 2: A Greeting/Salutation
To be honest, just go with your gut. It depends on the relationship you have with the person you intend to email. A simple "hello" works when you are emailing a fellow student
in regards to a group assignment. If you're addressing a stranger or a person of respect, then "dear' works best. Ensure you use their correct title in correspondence
such as Ms./Mr./Mrs. (If in doubt about a womanâ€™s marriage status, use Ms.)

# 3: A Kind Welcome
This step is the simplest. "I hope your week has been going well!" or something of the sort is all you need. It sets your tone for the email and demonstrates
you care about the individual you are emailing. 

# 4: Organization
As previously stated, people want to skim emails to get the point rather than read long, over the top essays. By organizing it by block, you adjust
the readability to be more concise, and you make it easier to respond to. 

# 5: A Transition line & Closing
Ending with "Thank you for your time." and heading at the bottom with "Respectfully," or "Warmly," with an indent followed by your name is just standard procedure.
