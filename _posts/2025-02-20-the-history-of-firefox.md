# A Short History of Mozilla Firefox

# Mozilla & Phoenix: The beginning
NCSA Mosaic 0.5 launched its browser in 1992. <br><br>
This was before the internet became mainstream, but amongst users, this browser gained traction. A little after this, Jim Clark and Marc Andreessen founded Netscape. The company's browser overcame Mosaic in terms of popularity and had a range of features that made it the superior browsing option at the time. Microsoft "reduced it to ashes" with the coming of Internet Explorer come the 2000s. <br><br>
The Mozilla Project launched in 1998, [to clean up and fix the open-source Netscape code.](https://web.archive.org/web/20021001071727/wp.netscape.com/newsref/pr/newsrelease558.html) However, the code was messy, so three developers (David Hyatt, Joe Hewitt, and Blake Ross) began development on a browser they called "Phoenix"; they launched the first version in 2002. It had features like tab browsing and a pop up blocker built in that Internet Explorer didn't but Internet Explorer still had 90% of users on it. <br><br>
A different company [IBPhoenix](https://www.ibphoenix.com/) wasn't happy about the shared name, so Mozilla changed the browser to **Firefox** in 2004. <br><br>

# Firefox: The Upward Arrow & "Golden Age"
[By 2007, Firefox had grown a good deal in stocks and became a promising source of technological innovation.](https://blog.mozilla.org/press/2006/12/the-world-economic-forum-announces-technology-pioneers-2007-mozilla-selected/) For Mozilla, the sun didn't set and the skies were clear. <br><br>
