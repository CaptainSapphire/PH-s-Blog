# The Great Race, Moorpark College Highlights and Work; What a saturday
The weekend was chaotic; so I'll put it all into one blog post. Enjoy!!

## The Great Race
The Great Race is an event held in Agoura every year where runners participate in a race (of varying lengths; 10k, 5k, one mile, half-marathon). Each year, my high school's National Honors Society sends volunteers. This year, I was signed up for the 5:30am-9:00am shift. <br><br>

I woke up at 3:30am (without alarm), and at 4:30am (with alarm). I arrived at 5:15am. (early is on time, on time is late, and late is unacceptable - my band director) <br>
