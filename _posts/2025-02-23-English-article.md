# Womanhood from Tennessee: A Retrospective of Growth
A mother with three girls and a husband, fresh from across the country; 72-year-old Deborah Santoyo was born in Tennessee 
and raised her kids in California. She shares with us a story of growing up and moving from safety to new things as a woman, 
time and time again. <br><br>

Growing up in Tennessee, she faced one main obstacle in her early years. 
“A lot of the struggles back then were if you lived far from the school; where I’m from, it *stormed*… 
it was difficult to do that walk.” Every day, she walked “at least 2 miles, maybe more. 
It was far, it would take you at least 30 minutes to walk home.” <br><br>

**However, despite being a young girl, she laughed and said “Back then, everything was safe.”** <br><br>


Moving to California though, was a lot different for young Deborah, who had just entered her mid-20s. 
California was very different from her hometown; she witnessed feminism through hippies and the push for social change. 
“I was in the time of the hippies, protesting in the park, smoking marijuana, boycotting the war, in Vietnam, which I agree with. 
I did not go to boycotts, but I totally agree with them. They were fighting a war that never should have been.” <br><br>

As she transitioned into womanhood, she saw a lot of unfairness and imbalance in her country. 
There was a grit in her voice as she told me that “the government should provide veterans with homes, 
they should provide them with everything. And you see it. You see people standing on corners, you see TV programs, y’know?” <br><br>

Soon enough, the war was over and she was having kids. She said 
“The doctors asked me how I wanted to have my kids and if I wanted to have ‘em natural, and I’m like 
‘Isn’t that the way they all have kids, natural?’” She chuckled. “So I really didn’t know about all the epidurals, 
and all this other stuff people did so they’d be in less pain cos’ for me it was painful. 
But I went through the pain. *Joyous pain!*” <br><br>
