# Hyperanalyzing Oshi No Ko's Opening
I thoroughly enjoy analyzing whatever media I consume on a deeper level, and regadless of the fact it's an anime or not, I think it could be interesting to go deeper into understanding the meaning behind *Oshi No Ko*'s opening.
<mark>come back to later</mark>

## Context
*Oshi No Ko* is an anime released in 2023, with season 2 airing currently in 2024. The manga is nearing its completion as the anime approaches the climax of the Play Arc. 
The anime is about the life and death of well-beloved idol, Ai, and the mystery of her murder. The second opening is pretty complex, and there are many elements I want to analyze. 
I would reccomend giving the first two seasons a watch before reading this post. There are no manga spoilers, but there are season 2 spoilers.
I will be looking at this from a literary perspective, keeping what I've learned from English in mind.

## Analyzing Every Frame of the Art
### First 20 Seconds
- **Glitching Siblings**: In the first 3 seconds we get a shot of Aqua and Ruby, and then a close-up shot of each of their faces. Their faces glitch and overlap with that of their previous lives. This likely symbolizes their inner conflict based on their previous lives.
- **Yoriko and Abiko**: The two writers stand side by side, demonstrating their bond in the show, but also the episode that focuses on Abiko's conflict, and how Yoriko is there, supporting Abiko at her side. This is also seen in their hands, holding the pens they used in Abiko's episode.
- **Akane versus Kana**: The two of them raise swords at each other as they stand under a bridge together. This symbolizes their outer conflict, as their rivalry is a focus point at the start of S2. The swords in their hands are the swords from the play they are in together, showing how they use the play as a tool for their rivalry. 
- **Sayuka and Melt**: The two boys are actors in the play, with mild inner conflicts. Melt did horribly on Sweet Today, and that shows in his drive to improve. Sayuka struggles personally as well, though I am less sure as to what, as my focus on this season isn't on this character. Sayuka looks from the light to the shade, symbolizing he's willing to look at the issues in his acting to improve.
- **Taiki**: Taiki is a quiet prodigy, amazing at acting but otherwise not very social- hence the hood and the fact he's also under the bridge.
- **Sumiaki, Goa, and Toshiro**: The adults in control of the play. They turn and look at the camera, implying that they are there perhaps to keep an eye, or that all eyes are on the cast of the play. 
- **Mem-Cho**: She looks downward to the camera with a smile, and another member of the introduction who isn't under the bridge. She's in the public eye, same as the adults running the play, which is perhaps why she is not under the bridge. 
- <mark>**UNSURE**: We get a close shot of a girl smiling, and I couldn't find anything about her on the wiki. I have yet to see something, or I am forgetting something. Mem-cho stands in the middle of the supporting characters- or the characters who support the main cast in their own ways.
From the looks of it, the main cast in the play are in under the bridge. The bridge could be the pressure of the play or the fact the public doesn't see what happens behind the scenes of these actors.  </mark>

<mark>Then, we get a visual of Aqua and Ruby on a small platform that has stairs on the side. This is something used in theatre. The camera is looking at them from a crowd, and the background swaps between a stadium and what seems to be a hospital. The sides of the screen slide in, a visual effect taking inspiration from the main plot, regarding the 2.5D theatre.
The camera zooms in past the crowd as the image changes to the main cast of this season, all standing outside. This whole segment could symbolize the truth beyond the crowd and beyond the public eye, as the crowd disappears as we see more than just Aqua and Ruby approaching a stage.</mark>
<br><br>
### 20sec-30sec
- **Aqua and Ruby**: We get a visual of the two of them putting on masks with their reincarnated faces. This mirrors the glitching effect of the beginning of the OP, with their inner conflict being reflected as a focal point.
- **Knife**: A knife slides down and childhood Aqua in the reflection closes his eyes. Ai was stabbed in the side, so this is a direct parallel to that event, and how much this event affected Aqua.
- **Ruby getting back into bed**: As her worship for Ai plays to the side of her bed, Ruby(Sarina) returns to her hospital bed. This could be the fact Ruby, at the loss of Ai, is returning to her safety, or her prison.
<mark>- **Tsukuyomi, Abiko, Aqua**: From what I understand, Tsukuyomi's a wild card, hence why she claps to the song, seemingly enjoying what is occurring. She's in a black suit because she associates with death. Abiko is in the background, with the face she makes as she stresses out over the production of the play. More than anything, this feels as another reminder of the conflicts going on behind the murder. In the literal sense, in front of Abiko is Aqua, reforming as his previous life's self's costume, with the body of Aqua. He smiles to the camera, implying some discovery has been made.
- **Three Hands**: Three hands reach from the area where Aqua was. The most likely thing is this is not just a countdown for the introduction, but the Hoshino's hands. Ai, Aqua, Ruby, reaching from the darkness, reaching, most likely, for the truth. 

### 30sec-47sec
We get a visual of Aqua walking on the top of a building as memories of Ai play in the background. 
-**Theatre seats**: We then get a shot of everyone who knows the whole truth of Ai watching from a theatre. The theatre are taditional red, which could be symbolic of Ai's death. Ai, who is seemingly a holograph, is dancing onstage. It vaguely reminds me of Hatsune Miku, which is projected onstage via light fixture. The characters then swing red light sticks. To quote the Fandom page of Oshi No Ko, "Ruby's glowstick idol color is red, which is the same color as Ai." This could mean the celebration of both characters, but mostly seems to be a visual. 
- **Two Hands**: After Ai's death, it was just Ruby and Aqua, hence why Ai's hand is no longer reaching out. 
We return to a far shot of Ruby and Aqua running on the top of the building.
-  <mark>**Gorou**:
- **Sarina**: Sarina(Ruby's old life) is seen looking our a window, as the camera is placed behind some wall. This is another reference to her internal conflict, as she desires to be free in that life.
- **At the Door**: Ruby and Aqua sit at the door, where Ai died. They look empty, leaning on each other. This directly represents how they rely(lean) on each other in Ai's death, and how in the show, it haunts them. 

We again return to the rooftop.

### 48sec-55sec
We get a shot of the building Ruby and Aqua are on, then the two of them holding hands walking forward. Aqua is leading Ruby somewhere- symbolism how he is the driving force in their search for the truth.<br>
Ai turns and looks at them before turning back and running away from them into a screen, as we are in the perspective of Aqua and Ruby. We see their hands reach out to her, illustrating their true love and devotion for Ai.<br>
The two of them start running toward Ai, which is off the building. This could mean a few things:
- Their drive to find the truth of Ai is self destructive
- They are willing to do everything for Ai
- The truth is blinding
- They are blinded by their search for Ai
At the climax of the song, the two of them, with the star in each of their's eyes, reach for Ai and jump. Taking a peak at the lyrics, "Without you, I cannot live" implying the jump is indeed for suicide or self-destruction. However, this could be their jump into their search for the truth, as without the leap they cannot live.

### 56 sec-1:06 mins
The two of them are holding hands as the angrily look down/as they fall. Aqua transforms into Touki, the antagonist from the play he's performing in. Their roles in the play may get it's own post in terms of symbolism. However, this is a clear indication that in his drive for truth, he is now playig Touki, and that these two facts strongly tie to each other. 
- **Princess Saya versus Tsuurugi**: The two characters played by Akane and Kana. This is a parallel of the conflict seen at the very beginning of this blog post- now taking form and manifesting through their play's performance. This is once more a visual of their rivalry and conflict.
- **The two manga artists**: This is a reference to Abiko's episode, which is also a parallel to an earlier mention of their conflict.
- <mark>**shocked girl**
- **Ruby**: Ruby in her B Komachi costume does a dance with red heart balloons in the back. This is a reminder, more than anything, of what Ruby is up to.
- **The play**: We get some interesting art of the battle, which doesn't symbolize anything that the roles don't already cover.

### 1:07mins-1:17mins
*It is to be noted memories and shots from the anime flash over each of these scenes.
- **Fatal, Deadly, Tragic love**: As they sing fatal, deadly, tragic love, aqua is seen with his closest friends, then him and his sister, and then himself. Fatal, meaning Causing ruin or destruction; disastrous, could mean that his relationships are all relating to causes of ruin. Deadly love between him and his sister is their ties to Ai's death. Tragic love with himself would be Aqua's undying and everlasting love for Ai, as it is sad, and tragic.
- **Destined, defining, fated**: As they sing destined, defining, fated love, the the roles (from the play) of the four seen in the previous shot stand (plus the other two actors). Destined love would be that acting brought them together, like it's *destiny*. Defining, meaning Any process serving to define the shape of something, would be the experiences that shaped the main four. Fated would be Kana and Akane's fated rivalry, as their acting styles, personalities, futures, past, and characters are natural foils and directly contrast each other. 
- **Inevitable, Certain, Eternal love**: This is a shot of the new members of B Komachi together. Inevitable meaning it was bound for them to come together, and love each other. Certain meaning fixed or inevitable, with the three of them still together. Eternal, is only a shot of Ruby. Ruby will eternally love idols and especially Ai, as seen in the literal case, where she died and brought it back.
