# Hyperanalyzing Oshi No Ko's Opening
I thoroughly enjoy analyzing whatever media I consume on a deeper level, and regadless of the fact it's an anime or not, I think it could be interesting to go deeper into understanding the meaning behind *Oshi No Ko*'s opening.

## Context
*Oshi No Ko* is an anime released in 2023, with season 2 airing currently in 2024. The manga is nearing its completion as the anime approaches the climax of the Play Arc. 
The anime is about the life and death of well-beloved idol, Ai, and the mystery of her murder. The second opening is pretty complex, and there are many elements I want to analyze. 
I would reccomend giving the first two seasons a watch before reading this post. There are no manga spoilers, but there are season 2 spoilers.
I will be looking at this from a literary perspective, keeping what I've learned from English in mind.

## Analyzing Every Frame of the Art
### First 20 Seconds
- **Glitching Siblings**: In the first 3 seconds we get a shot of Aqua and Ruby, and then a close-up shot of each of their faces. Their faces glitch and overlap with that of their previous lives. This likely symbolizes their inner conflict based on their previous lives.
- **Akane versus Kana**: The two of them raise swords at each other as they stand under a bridge together. This symbolizes their outer conflict, as their rivalry is a focus point at the start of S2. The swords in their hands are the swords from the play they are in together, showing how they use the play as a tool for their rivalry. 
-  **Yoriko and Abiko**: The two writers stand side by side, demonstrating their bond in the show, but also the episode that focuses on Abiko's conflict, and how Yoriko is there, supporting Abiko at her side. This is also seen in their hands, holding the pens they used in Abiko's episode.
- **Sayuka and Melt**: The two boys are actors in the play, with mild inner conflicts. Melt did horribly on Sweet Today, and that shows in his drive to improve. Sayuka struggles personally as well, though I am less sure as to what, as my focus on this season isn't on this character. Sayuka looks from the light to the shade, symbolizing he's willing to look at the issues in his acting to improve.
- **Sumiaki, Goa, and Toshiro**: The adults in control of the play. They turn and look at the camera, implying that they are there perhaps to keep an eye, or that all eyes are on the cast of the play. 
- **Taiki**: Taiki is a quiet prodigy, amazing at acting but otherwise not very social- hence the hood and the fact he's also under the bridge.
- **Mem-Cho**: She looks downward to the camera with a smile, and another member of the introduction who isn't under the bridge. She's in the public eye, same as the adults running the play, which is perhaps why she is not under the bridge. 
- **UNSURE**: We get a close shot of a girl smiling, and I couldn't find anything about her on the wiki. I have yet to see something, or I am forgetting something. Mem-cho stands in the middle of the supporting characters- or the characters who support the main cast in their own ways.
From the looks of it, the main cast in the play are in under the bridge. The bridge could be the pressure of the play or the fact the public doesn't see what happens behind the scenes of these actors.

Then, we get a visual of Aqua and Ruby on a small platform that has stairs on the side. This is something used in theatre. The camera is looking at them from a crowd, and the background swaps between a stadium and what seems to be a hospital. The sides of the screen slide in, a visual effect taking inspiration from the main plot, regarding the 2.5D theatre.
The camera zooms in past the crowd as the image changes to the main cast of this season, all standing outside. This whole segment could symbolize the truth beyond the crowd and beyond the public eye, as the crowd disappears as we see more than just Aqua and Ruby approaching a stage.

### 20sec-30sec
- **Aqua and Ruby**: We get a visual of the two of them putting on masks with their reincarnated faces. This mirrors the glitching effect of the beginning of the OP, with their inner conflict being reflected as a focal point.
- **Tsukuyomi, Abiko, Aqua**: From what I understand, Tsukuyomi's a wild card, hence why she claps to the song, seemingly enjoying what is occurring. She's in a black suit because she associates with death. Abiko is in the background, with the face she makes as she stresses out over the production of the play. More than anything, this feels as another reminder of the conflicts going on behind the murder. In the literal sense, in front of Abiko is Aqua, reforming as his previous life's self's costume, with the body of Aqua. He smiles to the camera, implying some discovery has been made. 
- **Three Hands**: Three hands reach from the area where Aqua was. The most likely thing is this is not just a countdown for the introduction, but the Hoshino's hands. Ai, Aqua, Ruby, reaching from the darkness, reaching, most likely, for the truth. 
- **Ruby getting back into bed**: As her worship for Ai plays to the side of her bed, Ruby(Sarina) returns to her hospital bed. This could be the fact Ruby, at the loss of Ai, is returning to her safety, or her prison.
- **Knife**: A knife slides down and childhood Aqua in the reflection closes his eyes. Ai was stabbed in the side, so this is a direct parallel to that event, and how much this event affected Aqua.

### 30sec-
We get a visual of Aqua walking on the top of a building as memories of Ai play in the background. We then get a shot of everyone who knows the whole truth of Ai watching from the
