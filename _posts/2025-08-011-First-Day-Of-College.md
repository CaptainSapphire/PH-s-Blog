# My First Day Of College: Educational Journey Update
Today was my first day of college! (Again). While I took an in-person summer class, the fall semester is where it really starts, and it is here! <br><br>

## Intro
I arrived at Moorpark College around 8:10am; there was a tent set up at the main upper parking lot, where two counselors sit. <br><br>
I asked them where the "FORU" is, since that is where my first class is located. I attempted to search for it the night prior, but I could not find any definite answers. ChatGPT and Google Gemini both said it was/located in the Applied Arts (AA) building. Given that location is odd for a computer science class, I figured I would ask for directions in the morning. <br><br>
Flash back to the morning, and the counselors are unsure of where that is as well. Someone else from the same class approached asking the same question shortly after, and one of the counselors searched the [Moorpark College Website](https://www.moorparkcollege.edu/) for answers.
