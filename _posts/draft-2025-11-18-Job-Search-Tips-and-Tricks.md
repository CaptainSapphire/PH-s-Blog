What do companies look for in relation to minimum requirements versus preferred requirements? What advice do you have for determining a role is applicable to apply to?
- Seek companies who have fluidity in what the company is looking for --> good opportunity
- Strict requirements you don't have --> those companies more likely than not will not screen your resume
- Tailor your resume so at the least you get screened
