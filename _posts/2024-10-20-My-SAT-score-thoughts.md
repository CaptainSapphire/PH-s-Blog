# I got my SAT score back: How was it?

## The score
I got a slightly above-average score of 1130, which is slightly lower than the average of my school. I'm satisfied with my score, but at the same time, if I get the opportunity to retake it, I'll certainly get a higher score.

## Compared to my PSAT
I got a 1200 on my PSAT, and I didn't review for that at all. However, I think most of the geometry-related concepts were much, much fresher in my mind.
I didn't need any formulas or SOH-CAH-TOA, and if I were to retake the SAT, I would put a lot more focus on geometry, since there were definitely large portions of the math section where I could not recall anything from geometry.<br><br>

*Here is evidence from the SAT of how the geometry and trig sections were the weakest.*<br><br>

Looking at the finer details, I actually did worse in the English section. The performance in each area wasn't bad but could be strengthened, especially "Information and Ideas" (based on a look at the details from this SAT.) I would, next time, do at least half of the English/Writing Khan Academy prep. <br><br>

## How was my prep?
I didn't take a lot of measures to prepare for the SAT. I think I could've started earlier on preparation.
A majority if not the entirety of my studying occurred on the [Khan Academy SAT course](https://www.khanacademy.org/test-prep/digital-sat). I think
for the amount of time I put into it, I got an acceptable score. 

## Final Thoughts
At the end of the day, I got what I gave. Had I given more time and focused more on certain areas, then I would've gotten higher. 
However, I don't see a reason to be hard on myself in that I got an acceptable score.
I'm going to a UC/CSU after Community College, so there's not a lot of pressure to do well on the SAT regardless. Thank you for reading :)
