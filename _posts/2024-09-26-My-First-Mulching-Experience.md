# My First Mulching Experience: How did it go?

## What is Mulching

As stated above from *JK Cooper Tree Services,* Mulching is a gardening technique that improves a plant's growing conditions. 

## Background Context
NHS (National Honors Society) is a group hosted among high schools across the nation. To be a part of NHS at my school, you need to take at least one AP/Honors class, be at least a sophomore, and have a minimum 3.0 GPA (I think). I received the invitation a month ago and secured my place via the accepted application yesterday. <br><br>
As a member of NHS, I must maintain my grades, but also I am required to participate in 3 service events each semester. 
On Monday, the NHS Mulching Volunteer event signups opened, and I signed up. Because I had a concert, I got clearance to leave early, but I got in with 11 other people. 


## The Event Itself
With a temperature of 64-70Â°f, the all-black was not the best attire to wear. However, I was preoccupied with concert preparations and was required to wear a band polo to promote the program. My poor choice of footwear was not ideal either, but you've gotta take it in stride. <br><br>
Speaking of stride, I walked from the band room to the tennis courts, with a pile of mulch about the height of the average middle schooler sitting in a couple of parking spots, off to the side of the lot. I approached the white truck and signed in. I was directed to shovel mulch into barrels. Other students will take the mulch and take it to a section where more volunteers will reap it into the soil. <br><br>
I was given gardening gloves, a mask (I doubt I've worn one since COVID), and a rake. From 3:30-4:00pm, I was shoveling. It was nice to do physical work, strangely enough. I see the fulfillment that can be achieved from going to the gym through this activity.

## A Reflection
I got my NHS credit, and I did my portion of labor. However, there's always something to learn. I learned what mulching is, and the most efficient way to shovel it. (Tip: Use gloves to remove any branches so the dirt of the mulch can be shoveled with more ease.) Additionally, I see the enjoyment in pure exercise, as strange as it sounds. In marching band, there's much more to think about, but with this activity, there wasn't a lot more besides "shovel dirt, place dirt." <br><br>
Well, thank you for reading and...
