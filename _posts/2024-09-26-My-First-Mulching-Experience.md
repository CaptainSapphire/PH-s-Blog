# My First Mulching Experience: How did it go?

## What is Mulching
!["Mulching Definition"](https://github.com/CaptainSapphire/PH-s-Blog/blob/main/assets/September%202024/Screenshot%202024-09-26%208.39.57%20AM.png?raw=true)<br>
As stated above from *JK Cooper Tree Services,* Mulching is a gardening technique that improves a plant's growing conditions. 

## Background Context
NHS (National Honors Society) is a group hosted among high schools across the nation. To be a part of NHS at my school, you need to take at least one AP/Honors class, be at least a sophomore, and have a minimum 3.0 GPA (I think). I received the invitation a month ago and secured my place via the accepted application yesterday. <br><br>
As a member of NHS, I must maintain my grades, but also I am required to participate in 3 service events each semester. 
On Monday, the NHS Mulching Volunteer event signups opened, and I signed up. Because I had a concert, I got clearance to leave early, but I got in with 11 other people. 


## The Event Itself
With a temperature of 64-70Â°f, the all-black was not the best attire to wear. However, I was preoccupied with concert preparations and was required to wear a band polo to promote the program. My poor choice of footwear was not ideal either, but you've gotta take it in stride. 

## A Reflection
