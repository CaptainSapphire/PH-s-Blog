# IBM's Learn About a Career in AI (GWC)
[IBM SkillBuild](https://skillsbuild.org/) is a learning platform, which is teaming with [Girls Who Code](https://girlswhocode.com/) to provide Girls Who Code students like myself preparation to enter the workforce! One of the activities is called "Learn about a career in AI." Here's what I learned:

## What I learned
According to Igor Perisic, a Chief Data Officer at LinkedIn in [2018](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/09/artificial-intelligence-shaking-up-job-market/), "By 2025, work done by machines will jump from 29% to more than 50%." While this may *sound* scary, it is actually an opportunity to get a job making AI applications! <br><br>
According to the course (the source provided has been taken down) "In 2019, there were 7,000 AI job openings in the United States alone." <br><br>
Because of this growing field and generally good opportunity, IBM encourages to build the skills to enter, by 
"Enter AI competitions like battlebots, kaggles, or hackathons
• Create a chatbot <br><br>
• Learn GitHub and Kaggle<br><br>
• Share code examples<br><br>
• Read AI blogs"<br><br>
<br><br>

2. Polish your skills to prepare for the future.
• Applied math<br><br>
• Problem solving<br><br>
• Data analysis<br><br>
• Algorithm structure<br><br>
• Probability and statistics<br><br>
• Programming languages such as Python, C++, R, or Java
<br><br><br><br>

And, finally: "chart your course to a great career!"<br><br>
• Dig into online training opportunities.<br><br>
• Seek out an internship.<br><br>
• Invest in an associate or bachelor degree.<br><br>

## Final Thoughts
Thank you to Girls Who Code for providing this IBM preparatory course!! <br><br>
