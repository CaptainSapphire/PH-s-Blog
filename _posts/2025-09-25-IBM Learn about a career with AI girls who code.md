According to Igor Perisic, a Chief Data Officer at LinkedIn in [2018](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/09/artificial-intelligence-shaking-up-job-market/), "By 2025, work done by machines will jump from 29% to more than 50%." While this may *sound* scary, it is actually an opportunity to get a job making AI applications! <br><br>
According to the course (the source provided has been taken down) "In 2019, there were 7,000 AI job openings in the United States alone." <br><br>
