# Changing Majors.

## It's time to tell a story. 
Once upon a time, there was a girl attending Oak Hills Elementary. Then she attends Medea Creek Middle School. For all of that time, she believed she was going to be a doctor. An anesthesiologist. 
**Then, in the span of what felt like two weeks, her world collapsed.** <br><br>
COVID hit. Kids were taken out of school and began attending from home. I was in 8th grade at the time. That year, I gained access to free internet for the first time, and I fell down the rabbit hole of YouTube. <br><br>

She learned so many things from so many communities. There are people out there, like her. There, an idea was planted in her head, one that would change the course of her life forever (that's a bit dramatic, even for me).<br><br>

**Your life is your own.** <br><br>

I realized I never wanted to do med on my own. It wasn't an industry I wanted to work in, and I respect those who did. But this world was told to me to be the best option. And I wanted to be *the best* just like any other kid.<br><br>
From there, I learned about the successful, lucrative, enjoyable computer science industry. It wasn't just one thing, it was a statue with big, wide arms. Programming, marketing, product management, and teaching- it felt like every aspect of life was touched by computer science. So, I stepped into high school with a bag on my back and a goal in my mind. To be a star in Computer Science. 
<br><br>
Throughout high school, I took courses to learn programming and computer science. FreeCodeCamp, CodeAvengers, GirlsWhoCode, especially. <br><br>
Then, senior year, I felt something shift in the Computer Science industry. OpenAI releases ChatGPT, and China drops Deepseek. Technology is constantly changing and evolving, and in Computer Science you have to constantly be up to date skill wise. I feel stressed following, or trying to follow what's happening. <br><br>

I'm not here to bash Computer Science but to recognize its flaws. The constant stress or pressure to be on top because of how saturated the field is and how much it covers (AI, machine learning, software development, frontend, backend, product management, programming, blog posts, etc etc etc...) became clear to me this year. I want to work and feel stable, and I think fighting to be enough all of the time is not the kind of environment I'd like to work in. <br><br>
So it has flaws, big deal. Is this still where I want to work though, and is there maybe something else that works better for me? <br><br>
Short answer yes, long answer... <br><br>


## Introduction to Data Science (in relation to Computer Science)
!["Slide 5"](https://github.com/CaptainSapphire/PH-s-Blog/blob/main/assets/February%202025/slide5.png?raw=true)<br><br>
Data Science seems to take the aspects of what I like most about Computer Science and focus on them. In particular, Python. I took the Data Science courses GirlsWhoCodeoffered in their Self Paced Program two years ago, and it was my favorite course I've ever taken because of its use of Python and the projects I got to build [(view here)](https://github.com/CaptainSapphire/GirlsWhoCode/tree/main/SPP-2023/Data%20Science).<br><br>
!["Slide 6"](https://github.com/CaptainSapphire/PH-s-Blog/blob/main/assets/February%202025/slide6.png?raw=true)<br><br>
Here is another slide that adds to my previous point.<br><br>
So Data Science is part of computer science and math, what else?

## Unemployment Rate
!["Slide 8"](https://github.com/CaptainSapphire/PH-s-Blog/blob/main/assets/February%202025/slide8.png?raw=true)<br><br>
The Computer Science Industry feels like it is in a state of panic with its unemployment rate of ~7.8% (twice what's okay). Typically, 4% unemployment is what is desirable as it is only [frictional unemployment](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=define+frictional+unemployment&ia=web). Meanwhile, the Data Science unemployment [(according to zippia.com)](https://www.zippia.com/data-scientist-jobs/demographics/) works in a wave where it generally remains low. To me, it's simple in terms of "go where the jobs are" and go where there's less unemployment and [general panic](https://news.yahoo.com/news/computer-science-grads-job-market-091301837.html?guccounter=1). 

## Money, Money, Money
!["Slide 10"](https://github.com/CaptainSapphire/PH-s-Blog/blob/main/assets/February%202025/slide10.png?raw=true)<br><br>
Both industries make big money. Bonuses, Data Science is based or very concentrated in the state *I* live in: **California**. So perhaps keeping both majors or subjects in mind would be good...<br><br>
To be frank, the salary is what attracted me to Computer Science in the first place. Money is 70% of the reason why I'd work, with the other 30% being general life fulfillment. I've been told over and over again how much *money doesn't make you happy*, and to do what makes you happiest. I disagree. Sacrifices must be made to be successful, and "loving your job" to me is one of them. 

## Cons of Both Industries (Give me the bad news first...)
!["Slide 12"](https://github.com/CaptainSapphire/PH-s-Blog/blob/main/assets/February%202025/slide12.png?raw=true)<br><br>
Data Science seems to be high stress, although my Computer Science teacher tells me it won't be around for very long and that it is very oversaturated. I'm not sure of the truth in this, although it is something to consider. <br><br>
!["Slide 13"](https://github.com/CaptainSapphire/PH-s-Blog/blob/main/assets/February%202025/slide13.png?raw=true)<br><br>
Computer Science is an intense market with a lot of layoffs, and it is generally an extreme environment from what I've heard. 

## Pros of Both Industries (Okay, so what's the good news?)
!["Slide 15"](https://github.com/CaptainSapphire/PH-s-Blog/blob/main/assets/February%202025/slide15.png?raw=true)<br><br>
What's funny is when I searched the pros of Computer Science, it initially gave me the cons... <br><br>
Anyway, overall, it seems Computer Science covers a wider range of topics, and has a higher average salary. However, data science has a lower unemployment rate and is relatively lucrative while not having weekly layoffs across the board.

## What next?
Right now, I'm picking out all my classes as I plan to go to Moorpark for two years and transfer to UCLA (or another UC/CSU). It's been going well, although I'm missing the STATS 20 transfer class, but no community college in CA offers that class. So, I'm currently sorting that out. Otherwise, the schedule of classes I've picked fits all of the transfer requirements. I need to switch out some classes to honors so I can do the Honors Program and get TAP certified. That'll be a blog post, eventually!

## Final Thoughts
This is a whole thing, but it's not a point of stress, interestingly enough. I think I'm going to major in Data Science and minor/alternative major in Computer Science so I can transfer to UCLA (I can't get TAP certified as a Computer Science major as it isn't in the UCLA College of Letters and Science.) I still very much enjoy Computer Science, and I mean nothing malicious when I criticize the industry. To me, I'm just trying to go where the jobs are. Anyway, thank you for reading! This was a longer blog post, so I really appreciate it. :)
