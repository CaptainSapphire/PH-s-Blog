# How to upload a CD/DVD to a Microsoft OS Computer using an External ODD & HDD Device
### It's a long title, but relatively simple, trust me! <br>
**First**, ensure your device is plugged in to your computer. There should be a little light that comes on when you plug it in. <br><br> 
**Second**, create the location you want to copy the CD/DVD onto on your device. If you do not know where to put it, continue reading this section.<br><br> 
Click on "Downloads." Right Click and press "Create Folder." For now, title it "DVD Downloads" followed by today's date. Rename at your peer/boss's instruction. 
To rename, simply right click on a file, and press "rename."
<br><br> 
**Third**, press the button on your external ODD & HDD device. The tray should then pop outwards. <br><br> 
Follow that by placing your CD/DVD into the tray, with the design of the object facing upwards, and the holographic side facing down. <br><br> 
**THIS IS IMPORTANT!**: Ensure your CD/DVD is clicked into the middle bit of the tray. If you close it and the device starts beeping at you, you did it wrong.<br><br>
**Fourth**, navigate back to your device. If you go to the area below your pins, under "This PC" and whatnot of the side navigation, you should see a CD icon appear.
That is where your data is being put! <br><br> 
Now go brew some coffee, take a minute to let your information upload to the system. <br><br> 
Once it is done, the external device's fan should turn off, and the light will turn off (though it might not stay off forever given power is running to it). <br><br>
