# My last Football Game: Senior Night
If you don't know, I am part of Oak Park High School's Eagle Brigade, or their Marching Band. For the last four years, I have attended 6-7 football games each season, performing pep tunes and our show. However, on Friday, we had the season's last football game. However, it's also my last football game, ever. I'm in my senior year of marching band after all, so here's how it went. 

## The Start
The band room was locked until 15 minutes before call time, which made preparations difficult for some marching band members. I played cards outside the band room with some friends before we all got set up. We made our way to the great lawn, and got our stars. I have four stars on my uniform now, and we haven't even gotten to our second competition. Either, he's frontloading giving them out, or I need to figure out more places to put them.

We all meet up with our families and walk down the field while our names and achievements are called out. <br><br>

## 1st and 2nd Quarter
We played a lot of pep tunes, nothing of note occured. 

## Halftime
The halftime performance went really well! I don't have any sense of shame in terms of a job being a job, but a lot of my friends didn't want to do the *Intergalactic Dance* in front of the school. 

## 3rd and 4th Quarter
