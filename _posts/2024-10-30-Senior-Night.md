# My last Football Game: Senior Night
If you don't know, I am part of Oak Park High School's Eagle Brigade, or their Marching Band. For the last four years, I have attended 6-7 football games each season, performing pep tunes and our show. However, on Friday, we had the season's last football game. However, it's also my last football game, ever. I'm in my senior year of marching band after all, so here's how it went. 

## The Start
The band room was locked until 15 minutes before call time, which made preparations difficult for some marching band members. I played cards outside the band room with some friends before we all got set up. We made our way to the great lawn and got our stars. I have four stars on my uniform now, and we haven't even gotten to our second competition. Either, he's frontloading giving them out, or I need to figure out more places to put them.

We all meet up with our families and walk down the field while our names and achievements are called out. <br><br>

## 1st and 2nd Quarter
We played a lot of pep tunes, but nothing of note occurred. 

## Halftime
The halftime performance went really well! I don't have any sense of shame in terms of a job being a job, but a lot of my friends didn't want to do the *Intergalactic Dance* in front of the school. It's been about a week, but the volunteers said we did much better during this performance than at the Moorpark Competition. Hopefully, we make even more improvements for next week's competition. 

## 3rd and 4th Quarter
I conducted *Dance The Night* as my song of choice for senior night. There aren't any videos, but that's okay. The memory of being up there with my friend is enough for me :) <br><br>
All my other senior friends conducted their pep tunes of choice, and the rest of the night went well. I overheard the Dodgers Game that night went well, so I can tell some members of the staff and crowd were... preoccupied, to say the least. Good for them, though!

## Final Thoughts
I had a lot of fun, and I'm grateful for the memories I've been given these four years. I'm not sad I'm going, but I am nostalgic for the times I had. I've experienced so very much through marching band, both good and bad. The lesson? Take it in stride, I suppose. Thank you for reading :)
