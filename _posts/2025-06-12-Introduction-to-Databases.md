# Introduction to Databases
I recently started learning SQL with [this FreeCodeCamp course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXV3zeQKqGY) and I figured I would update my readers(all of you!) on what I've learned so far. 

## Databases
**Databases** are collections of related data. For example, your phone's contact list: it has a name, and a number/email connected to it. I made a short video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cum_i-C1K-4) defining it. <br><Br>
!["a phone contact list"](https://www.howelawfirm.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/contacts-phone-favorites.jpg.webp)<br><Br>
*As seen in the image above, the phone's contacts have a number, picture, name all correlated in the collection that is the contact list.*

## Data Base Management Systems
A **DBMS** is a system/tool used to work with the data in a dataset/database. You can create/retrieve/view/search/delete/upload and more! Some common DBMS's are MySQL, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL, Oracle, and MongoDB. I made a short video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lg4wGLsCE_Y) defining it. <br><Br>
