## Notes
What is AI? AI is when computers are designed to be like human using math and statistics to answer prompts realistically. <br><br>
**How does it learn?** <br><br>

2. Patterns: The AI notice sunique differences in the data, patterns, like how all golden retrievers have a certain types of ears (pointy ears v. floppy ears) (Algorithms being the reason it can do this)
3. Decisions: Able to look at new data with new differences and make conclusions and distinctions
<br><br>
We then took a look at an example with [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/)
- Data: Different Justin Bieber facial expressions ("Class" of images being different expressions)
After inputting only a few images, the model got confused and produced an incorrect result, demonstrating a need for more data. From there, we experimented with classes and tried to get an accurate pattern recoginition from the model with more data. <br><br>

**Content Based filtering**
- hybrid to suggest content to user that would match
- ex: Netflix (genres from what you've liked AND other user's data)
- ex: Self Driving Cars
- ex: Duolingo (able to recognized and translated from varying languages)
<br><br>
**How does Black Rock use AI?** <br><br>

  - Use 3rd Party software to enable Black Rock employees to use an altered version of ChatGPT specific to BlackRock
  - Mainly for enhancing productivity
  - Next goal (and a continueous one): Use AI in investment management. Generate Alpha for Aladdin platform by risking success, trade execution
