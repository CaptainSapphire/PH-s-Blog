# My thoughts on the Sports recap
I was recently featured in the Fall Sports Recap article, published by the school newspaper, *The Talon*.
# Context
Here is the segment in which I was featured.

# Explaining 
From what I can observe, we have a couple of issues in the stands at football games. Communication is difficult with the noise and energy of the games, leading to us starting and ending not together. Regardless, I believe as a whole, we can work to make our entrances and cut-offs stronger. We typically play some of the same tunes each game, including *Fireball, Hey Baby, Sweet Caroline, Seven Nation Army, Pompeii, Avengers* and on some occasions, *Monster Tunes (Frankenstein and Iron Man).* As the season progresses, perhaps we can extend our pep tune range to play *Night Changes* or that One Direction Song in our pep tunes, along with ones we never play, such as *Go Eagles (Tequila)* or *Apache.*<br><br>
Middle School Band Night is this Thursday, in which I am truly excited for. We went from a 3A band to a 2A band over the years, and we border 1A. Giving the middle schoolers a taste of marching band could allow them to join, or convince their parents. In turn, we would have more members, after I graduate. However, I'm mostly excited for MSBN because my brother will join the trumpets, and get to play with me a bunch of pep tunes and even a half-time performance. Additionally, it's a fun type of chaos with the middle schoolers.

# Side thoughts
I'm surprised at the segments that the journalist took from the interview, being she focused on my critics. However, the overall recap had a theme of challenges, so I take little issue with it. I do wish she took the statement from Mr. Borquez as a closing note, as it could be a motivator to anyone who was reading from the marching band (he stated he was proud and excited for what is to come).

# Conclusion
I'm looking forward not just to the upcoming games or MSBN, but also to the heavy half of the season. I believe in the brigade, and our ability to make something cool this year, even if not champs. Go Eagles!, and thank you for reading. :)
