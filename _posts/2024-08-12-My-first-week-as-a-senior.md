# My first week back to High School as a Senior: How did it go?

Senior year has finally rolled around! Many of us are ready for it, while others dread it. But where do I fall? <br><br>
Like most things in life, there is a healthy middle point to be on a scale. Personally, I am excited to graduate from high school. To be completely honest, I am nervous though, for what lies ahead.  <br><br>
My first week back, despite all the feelings, was nothing out of the usual. I met my teachers, and they explained their assignments and their individual policies. I reconnected with old friends, and I was able to discuss with them in more confidence what we want to do with our future. To my pleasant surprise, I made some new friends in my classes as well! <br><br>
The individual impressions are not too crazy, but here's how my schedule is looking: 
1. TA for AP Computer Science - I took this class last year, so the concepts are nothing new. It's  simple tasks to aid the teaching process.
2. English IV Honors - I like my teacher's energy, and I am interested in the books we will be reading.
3. AP Precalculus - The workload seems to be on the heavier side, but the teacher has provided a lot of resources to support the students. It'll certainly be an interesting challenge. 
4. Wind Ensemble Honors - I am in the top band now, after years of practice, which is exciting! I look forward to performing many a tunes this year.
5. Free 5th - It's been pretty useful in terms of getting time to do homework, so I can spend time with family when I return home.
6. Economics CP - The teacher is funny, and the lessons are paced incredibly nicely. I am stoked for the major semester-long project, the Cookbook project. To be honest, I think it'll get a post of it's own.
7. Free 7th - Some more time to get homework done, but also time to prepare for marching band.
8. Marching band (8th per. sport) - I am enthusiastic in terms of the season. My section is preparing quite well, and I'm proud of the progress we've made thus far.
<br><br>
In terms of advice, I would say don't give too much or too little thought to anything. Senior year is important as the rest of your years, but it won't be the end-all-be-all, either. "You've got this!," to quote the AP precalc. summer work videos :)
