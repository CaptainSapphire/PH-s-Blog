# GWC Event: Learning AI: Pottery & More (With BlackRock)
## Context
[Girls Who Code](https://girlswhocode.com/) is a company who uplifts girls in STEM, and right now, I am in their Pathways Program. Every week, they host events with the company's partners. Tuesday, Julu 15th's was "Learning AI: Pottery & More (With BlackRock)." [Black Rock](https://www.blackrock.com/us/individual) is a bank where they help manage money for larger companies (not a bank for individuals). <br><br>

## Notes
What is AI? AI is when computers are designed to be like human using math and statistics to answer prompts realistically. <br><br>
**How does it learn?** <br><br>
<img src="https://github.com/CaptainSapphire/PH-s-Blog/blob/main/assets/July%202025/Screenshot%202025-07-15%20060608.png?raw=true" alt="AI Learning Diagram" width="300"/> <br><br>
2. Patterns: The AI notice sunique differences in the data, patterns, like how all golden retrievers have a certain types of ears (pointy ears v. floppy ears) (Algorithms being the reason it can do this) <br><br>
3. Decisions: Able to look at new data with new differences and make conclusions and distinctions
<br><br>
We then took a look at an example with [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/)
- Data: Different Justin Bieber facial expressions ("Class" of images being different expressions) <br><br>
After inputting only a few images, the model got confused and produced an incorrect result, demonstrating a need for more data. From there, we experimented with classes and tried to get an accurate pattern recoginition from the model with more data. <br><br>

**Content Based filtering**
- hybrid to suggest content to user that would match
- ex: Netflix (genres from what you've liked AND other user's data)
- ex: Self Driving Cars
- ex: Duolingo (able to recognized and translated from varying languages)
<br><br>

**How does Black Rock use AI?** <br><br>

  - Use 3rd Party software to enable Black Rock employees to use an altered version of ChatGPT specific to BlackRock
  - Mainly for enhancing productivity
  - Next goal (and a continueous one): Use AI in investment management. Generate Alpha for Aladdin platform by risking success, trade execution
<br><br>
**Questions (asked by me)** <br><br>
!["Aladdin Copilot"](https://github.com/CaptainSapphire/PH-s-Blog/blob/main/assets/July%202025/Screenshot%202025-07-15%20063048.png?raw=true) <br><br>
How did you guys pick your model for productivity? (Why Github Copilot?) Do you guys use Gemini or ChatGPT to any extent? (asked out loud)
- Offered as a SASS application, LLMS w/ in BlackRock
- There are teams that use GPT for text-based things, no gemini usage yet
- Does not let data from Black Rock out, so no open-source AI usage

## The Activity
Using AI to make Pottery is the fun ending activity. [Link to it here.](https://artsandculture.google.com/experiment/3d-pottery/nwHg1D0riJ1ltA?hl=en) <br><Br>
!["My Score"](https://github.com/CaptainSapphire/PH-s-Blog/blob/main/assets/July%202025/Screenshot%202025-07-15%20064329.png?raw=true)<br><br>
Goal was to replicate the *Terracotta amphora (jar)* <br><br>
While the activity was a lot of fun, there was a lot to learn! AI can be used for image analysis and help with recreating experiences like pottery making. 

## Final Thoughts
Although this event started at 6am PST, I would say it was well worth it to learn from all of these experts and connect. Thank you to Girls Who Code for this wonderful event.
