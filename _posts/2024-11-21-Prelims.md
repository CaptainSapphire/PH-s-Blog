# Marching Band Prelims: How it went
If you didn't already know, I am a part of the Marching Band at Oak Park High School. Our season comes to a peak when we compete at preliminaries, which dictates if we make it to championships.
All our hard work is tested as judges give our performance a numerical score. How did last Saturday's prelims go? 

# Before leaving the school
I arrived at the band room at 9:15 am, mistaking my call time for that of the pit/guard (who had to come earlier). I spent my time talking with varying members of the marching band. <br><br>
One of the low brass section leaders emerged from the director's office. He approached me and gave me a list of directions to share with the other members of leadership. 
I spent my remaining time informing leadership, and leadership informed their teams. I am the flute section leader, so I informed the three other flutes as well. <br><br>
At 9:45 the director left his office and debriefed the marching band in all his directions.<br>
- Do not put on uniforms, we will change into them later
- Get instruments onto the bus
- Check with your sections they have all parts of their uniform

# The bus ride and before the performance
Once we did all of those things, we all lined up outside the bus, in front of the band room. One student was missing, looking for something. We all waited for him to get his things, before getting impatient. Seniors boarded the bus. Juniors. Sophomores. Freshmen. The boy we all waited on was in the low brass section, so the low brass leaders got on last, cause they had to look for the boy. There wasn't room on the bus to sit alone, so one of the low brass section leaders was seated with me. We talked for a bit. <br><br>

Arriving on campus, we all went to get food from concessions. I packed a sandwich. We then ate in the stands together. All of Oak Park grouped together, so I got to talk about the performances with my friends. One of the songs was very familiar. At the end of said performance, it turns out their closing song was a part of our last year's show, *Firebird*. <br><br>

3:00 pm was the break, and I messaged the band via Remind "Prop people, come set up!" as the director wanted them to set up early. <br><br>
The entire band came over, but turns out a majority of them were there for the snacks.<br><br>

After the break, we all went back, watched some shows, and then returned to the bus. The bus was teeming with marchers at 4:30 pm, the time the director told us to be back by. 

# Prep for the performance
We all got uniforms on and instruments together and got pit off of the U-Haul. We all ran through the show, ran through warm-ups, exercises, and more. The director sent us off to our sections to do whatever we needed to do. This was potentially my last competition. I told my section: <br><br>
**"No matter what results we get, I am incredibly proud of our performance and each of you for giving it your all. Good luck everyone."**<br><br>
