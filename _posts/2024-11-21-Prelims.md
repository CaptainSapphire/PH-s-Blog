# Marching Band Prelims: How it went
If you didn't already know, I am a part of the Marching Band at Oak Park High School. Our season comes to a peak when we compete at preliminaries, which dictates if we make it to championships.
All our hard work is put to the test as judges gives our performance a numerical score. How did last Saturday's prelims go? 

# Before the Performance
I arrived at the band room at 9:15am, mistaking my call time for that of pit/guard (who have to come earlier). I spent my time talking with varying members of the marching band. 
One of the low brass section leaders emerged from the director's office. He approached me and gave me a list of directions to share with the other members of leadership. 
I spent my remaining time informing leadership, and leadership informed their teams. I am flute section leader, so I informed the three other flutes as well. <br><br>
